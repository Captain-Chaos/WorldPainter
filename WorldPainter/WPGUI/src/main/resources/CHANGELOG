-- Version 2.24.1, released 05-05-2025

 * Increase performance of the Pencil tool with large brushes or long lines by adding new fast mode
   + In fast mode, the Pencil tool can only draw lines with the default circular brushes. If you have a non-circular brush selected the tool will automatically use a solid circle of the same size
   + Fast mode is the default, but you can switch to slow mode on the Tool Settings panel for the Pencil tool
   + Slow mode is the old painting mode, which may hang or even crash the program if you try to draw lines too wide, long or fast, because it tries the paint the full brush shape along every pixel of the line; that does mean that the result is pixel perfect
 * Added a new Global Operation: change terrain height
   + You can raise (which will only affect lower ground), lower (only affects higher ground) or set the terrain height to a particular height
   + Like the other operations, you can apply this everywhere, or use the filter to apply it only to the selection, or some other condition
 * Preview of timings feature added
   + WorldPainter keeps track of how long it takes to perform individual Export stages and Layers
   + In this preview, the three longest stages or layers will be shown in the summary after the Export is finished
   + An upcoming release will display the timings in more detail
 * Bug fix: prevent a UI scaling error from crashing the program

-- Version 2.24.0, released 05-04-2025

 * Add Minecraft 1.21 support:
   + Support version 1.20.5 and later with non standard height datapack
   + Add Pale Garden biome
   + Add support for Importing short_grass (note that short grass is still exported as minecraft:grass, in order to support older versions, since Minecraft appears to correct the name upon first loading chunks)
   + Add Hanging Pale Grass, Eyeblossom and Pale Moss Carpet plants
   + Add Pale Moss Block terrain type
   + Add known properties of all new blocks

-- Version 2.23.2, released 20-10-2024

 * Bug fix: fix an error during config file migration. If your configuration was reset due to this error, you can get it back by shutting down WorldPainter, renaming the config.old file to config and restarting WorldPainter

-- Version 2.23.1, released 18-10-2024

 * Bug fix: the terrain panel no longer collapses when there is not enough space for its contents

-- Version 2.23.0, released 18-10-2024

 * Custom Object Layers now have a grid setting, to place objects only on a square grid of configurable size
   + In addition, an optional random displacement from those grid points can be specified for more variation
 * The spawn point can now be in a Custom Cave/Tunnel layer or on a floating dimension
   + Just edit the corresponding floor dimension and then use the Spawn tool to set the spawn point there
   + If the spawn point is moved during a test export because it is outside the selected tiles, it will always be moved to the surface
 * Added a warning when creating a Master Dimension, as people continue to do this by accident or without sufficient understanding. It will be displayed the first three times you try to create a Master Dimension
 * A new scripting operation has been added to obtain a numerical biome ID on map formats which use named biome IDs, since WorldPainter's scripting operations always need a numerical ID:
   biomeId = wp.getBiome().withName('minecraft:cherry_grove').go() // For vanilla biomes
   biomeId = wp.getBiome().fromWorld(world).withName('custom:mybiome').go() // For custom biomes from a particular world. Note that if there is more than one custom biome defined with the same name but different ID's, the result is undefined
 * Custom block spec files can now override the horizontal and vertical orientation schemes of the blocks, allowing WorldPainter to rotate and mirror them correctly (or disabling rotating and mirroring). See https://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/CustomBlocks for details

-- Version 2.22.1, released 22-1-2024

 * A preview of floating dimensions has been added
   + They work very similarly to Custom Cave/Tunnel layers:
   + You create a new floating dimension layer and configure what you want the default height of the floor to be
   + Then you paint the layer in the desired shape of the floating dimension. You'll most likely want to use a solid brush at 100%
   + Then you right-click the layer button and select "edit floor dimension" to customise the floating dimension floor
   + This is a preview! It is not finished and contains bugs. It exists mainly to solicit feedback. Please report your experiences in the WorldPainter subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldPainter
   + Known missing functionality:
     - Bottom layers do not yet work. These will work the same as roof layers for Custom Cave/Tunnel layers; they will be exported inverted at the bottom of the floating dimension
     - You cannot yet configure the material on the bottom of the floating dimension, or the shape of the edge of the floating dimension
     - There is no way yet to raise or lower the floating dimension after creating it, other than using the regular height tools. Don't try to use the Change Height screen; it will affect the surface dimension as well
     - A limited set of layers can be used on the floor dimension. This will be expanded later (in particular layers that affect the underground, such as underground pockets and the cave layers, will be supported)
     - 3D biomes are not yet applied to the map
 * The Find entry on Custom Layer button popups has been moved below the Edit entry
 * Bug fix: fix a crash when trying to add an existing layer to a Custom Cave/Tunnel layer roof or floor, when there are Custom Annotation layers present
 * Bug fix: fix a crash when Exporting a Custom Cave/Tunnel layer that has Custom Annotations

-- Version 2.22.0, released 3-12-2023

 * Custom Cave/Tunnel Layers can now be filled with artificial light, or a custom material
   + The four choices for the fill material are:
     - air (the default for existing layers)
     - cave_air (the default for new layers)
     - artificial block light with a configurable level (using the minecraft:light block)
     - a custom material of your own configuration
   + cave_air and artificial light are only available for map formats which support them
 * A "Find" choice has been added to the context menu of Custom Layer buttons, that will move the view to the nearest location where that layer has been painted. This makes it easier to quickly find where a layer is in use
 * Bug fix: fix a scripting error that occurred when creating filters
 * Bug fix: fix a bug that would sometimes prevent complex Custom Materials from working correctly

-- Version 2.21.3, released 20-10-2023

 * Check more thoroughly for incompatible blocks before Exporting in Minecraft 1.2 - 1.12 format, to try and prevent errors later in the Export
 * Bug fix: fix an error in the block compatibility check that was causing errors on Export when certain layer types were present

-- Version 2.21.2, released 20-10-2023

 * Make it slightly easier again to pick a solid colour for custom layers
 * Add support for schem files that were generating an error because they have a null value in their palette
 * Upgrade the installer to prevent an issue with dark mode on Macs
 * Bug fix: fix an error when importing masks at other than 100% scale
 * Bug fix: remove duplicate layers when loading .world files
 * Bug fix: eliminate several classes of errors that occurred when activating the eyedropper when it was already active - the selection is now cancelled instead
 * Bug fix: implement support for supporting floating cement blocks during post processing of Minecraft 1.12 maps
 * Various small bug fixes

-- Version 2.21.1, released 21-8-2023

 * Bug fix: make heightmap preview and tile selection work again
 * Bug fix: make selecting variations of biomes work again

-- Version 2.21.0, released 20-8-2023

 * Support for Minecraft 1.20 has been added, including:
   + Preview support for the new blocks by upgrading the embedded Dynmap to version 3.6
   + New plants for the Custom Plants layer: cherry saplings, pink petals, pitcher pods and plants and torchflower seeds and plants
   + The new Cherry Grove biome
   + Suspicious sand and gravel are Imported as sand and gravel, and are preserved on Merge
 * Custom Biomes can now also have custom patterns configured for rendering
   + To create or edit a pattern, click on the [...] button next to the Paint label on the Configure Custom Biome screen
   + Note that for Custom Biomes the opacity cannot be changed
 * Fence blocks and other connecting blocks (such as iron bars and glass panes) from old Custom Objects, from Minecraft versions that automatically managed those connections, will now be automatically connected to their neighbours on Export
   + This is only done for .bo2, .bo3 and .schematic objects
 * Structures (.nbt files) now always have their offset guesstimated when loading them as Custom Objects, since they do not store an offset. This will increase the chance that they will be placed correctly by default
 * Some biomes have received a slightly more distinctive pattern and/or colour
 * Bug fix: fix an error that occurred when Importing Minecraft 1.12 maps with custom biomes
 * Bug fix: creating a new Custom Layer from a renamed palette now adds it to the right palette

-- Version 2.20.0, released 13-8-2023

 * All custom layer types can now be rendered with custom patterns in addition to solid colours
   + To create or edit a pattern, click on the [...] button next to the Paint label on the layer's settings screen
   + This will open a very simple editor which allows you to choose a solid colour, or a transparent canvas, and then apply a pattern to it using a simple pencil tool and limited colour palette
   + The pattern will also be shown as the layer's icon on the palette
   + There is a separate slider to set the opacity of the layer (when it is at 100% intensity)
 * A new Custom Annotation layer type has been added
   + It is a very simple layer type that is not Exported and only serves to make custom annotations for display in the editor view, or as markers for scripts or complex operations
   + The new patterned layer rendering support described above also applies to these new Custom Annotation Layers
   + Since they are not Exported they are not visible on the Custom Layers tabs of the Export screen
 * Warnings for Test Exports are now only displayed once as long as they don't change
   + For regular Exports they are still always displayed
   + In addition the warnings are now always repeated on the Export Success screen

-- Version 2.19.0, released 5-8-2023

 * The name and layer order of palettes can now be edited by clicking on the cog icon in their top-right corner
 * The 3D view can now be configured to show: all above-ground layers (the default, and what it previously showed), no layers, or to be synchronised with the visible layers in the editor, using the new radio buttons on the toolbar
 * If the 3D view is set to be "always on top" when a new window is opened, the "always on top" option is turned off, to prevent the 3D view from blocking or obscuring the new window
 * Bug fix: fix the Annotations colours and colour names on the Import Mask screen

-- Version 2.18.4, released 27-6-2023

 * Bug fix: restore order of custom layers on palettes

-- Version 2.18.3, released 23-6-2023

 * The custom layer export order can now be reset to the default with the new Reset Order button on the Custom Layers tab on the Export screen
   + If the button is disabled then the layers are already in their default order
   + Export order customisation is not a well defined functionality and should be used with caution. The default order might change in the future, and it is currently the case that if you customise the order, all the non-custom layers (such as the default cave layers) are then exported _after_ all the custom layers for each stage
 * Halves of double high plants such as sunflowers that are missing their opposite halves will now be left in place if you uncheck the "remove from invalid blocks" setting on the Post Processing tab of the Export screen
 * Bug fix: fix a bug with layer sorting that prevented the Export screen from opening in some cases
 * Bug fix: properly post-process thin Custom Objects that are placed during the fixup phase
   + In addition, some more recently added plants, and lily pads, that were not being included in the post-processing are now included

-- Version 2.18.2, released 19-6-2023

 * Bug fix: fix a deserialisation error that occurred when loading some existing worlds

-- Version 2.18.1, released 17-6-2023

 * When importing a height map into the current dimension you can now choose to leave the terrain type alone
 * You can now drag and drop files onto the WorldPainter window to open them
   + .world files will be loaded as a WorldPainter world
   + Image files will allow you to choose to import them as a new world, a height map into the current dimension, or an image mask
 * Bug fix: fixed a NullPointerException that occurred when loading some older worlds
 * Bug fix: fixed an error when trying to Export a world that has Combined Layers which contain non-custom layers (e.g. Frost)
 * Bug fix: fix preview of leaf blocks that have a waterlogged property

-- Version 2.18.0, released 11-6-2023

 * Height map and mask import changes:
   + Floating point images are now supported for height maps and masks
   + 32-bit unsigned integer images are now supported for masks (they already were for height maps)
   + When opening the screen, the file selection dialog is now immediately shown
 * Custom Layers tab on the Export screen:
   + It now shows the constituent layers of Combined Layers, instead of the Combined Layers themselves
   + A "select" button has been added to allow selection of the layer from the map with the eyedropper
 * It is now possible to add a Nether or End dimension to Imported worlds
 * Crimson and Warped stems and hyphae are now treated as "logs" for purposes of leaf distance calculations
 * Some small usability improvements
 * Bug fix: selecting a paint from the map from the Global Operations screen now works more than once
 * Bug fix: selecting a paint from the map does not crash inside the selection (or when other system layers are present)
 * Bug fix: Merging a world that was not Imported will no longer cause it to be considered an Imported world afterwards
 * Bug fix: fix a crash on the Export screen related to the sorting of Combined Layers
 * Bug fix: fix a crash when Importing a map with an End dimension

-- Version 2.17.2, released 21-5-2023

 * The Eyedropper is now also available for selecting paints for the operations on the Global Operations screen
 * Bug fix: the Flatten tool no longer allows you to initiate it outside the bounds of the world
 * Small usability improvement

-- Version 2.17.1, released 13-5-2023

 * A new Eyedropper tool has been introduced that allows you to select paints directly from the map
   + It is available on the Tools panel in the shape of an eyedropper
   + It may also be activated by pressing Alt+y
   + To cancel without selecting anything, press the Esc key
   + The "only on" and "except on" brush settings filter menus now also have a "Select on Map" choice which allows you to similarly select the value from the map
     - This also applies to the filter on the Global Operations screen
   + In the near future this support will be extended to other places where a paint is selected, such as the terrain, layer and biome drop-downs on the Global Operations screen and other places
 * Icons and other UI elements are now scaled smoothly according to the UI scale setting, rather than only at integer increments, to make the UI scaling more consistent
 * Scripting: it is now possible to specify the lower and upper build limits of newly created worlds
   + This is done with the new withLowerBuildLimit(int) and withUpperBuildLimit(int) modifiers on the createWorld() operation
   + Both are optional, and default to the default build limit for the map format, or greater if that is necessary to accommodate the configured height mapping
   + Note that in WorldPainter the lower build limit is inclusive, but the upper build limit is exclusive (e.g for Minecraft 1.19 the default upper build limit is 320, meaning the highest a block may be placed is 319)
 * Some small usability improvements
 * Bug fix: custom biomes from pre-1.17 maps are now correctly added to the Biomes panel when Importing a map from Minecraft, with arbitrary colours and named "Biome n" where n is the numerical biome ID

-- Version 2.17.0, released 21-4-2023

 * WorldPainter now supports changing the lower build limit for Minecraft 1.18 and later map formats!
   + It can be changed when creating a new world, or from the Change Height screen (Edit menu), just like the upper build limit
   + It uses a data pack to implement the deviating build limit. Maps with deviating build limits may not load in newer versions of Minecraft!
   + The allowable range is between -2032 and 0, in steps of powers of two, just like the upper build limit
 * The annotations are no longer displayed in the 3D view if they are not configured to be Exported
 * You can now change the size of the render distance circle that you can activate with the "eye" toolbar button
   + Set the radius of the circle in chunks on the Configure View screen (Ctrl+V or View menu)
   + By default it is set to 12 chunks
 * Scripting: the full path to the directory containing the script file is now available as the `scriptDir` global variable
 * Some small bug fixes and error handling improvements

-- Version 2.16.0, released 12-3-2023

 * The material selection control has been simplified. Instead of always showing both legacy (numerical) and modern (name-based) choices it now only shows the appropriate choices for the currently selected map format
   + If you try to edit a material without a numerical ID with a map format selected that requires numerical IDs, an error message will be shown and you will be required to select a different, compatible material
 * The scale for importing height maps and masks, as well as the scale for overlay images, can now be specified with up to two decimals precision, for more accurate size control
 * Plants on the Custom Plants Layer settings screen are now disabled if they are not supported by the current map format
 * When changing between map formats with different minimum heights, the ceiling height of Ceiling Dimensions is now automatically adjusted to keep it at the same distance from the surface
 * New inverted icons have been added to make the Dark Metal visual theme look better, contributed by github.com/almic
 * Bug fix: fixed the crosshatching that shows where the surface and ceiling dimensions intersects, for the Minecraft 1.18 and higher map formats
 * Bug fix: fixed a bug that made it impossible to select block ID 31 for numerical ID-based map formats such as Minecraft 1.12
 * Bug fix: make pumpkin and melon stems from Custom Plants Layers export with the correct ages
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.18, released 4-1-2023

 * Many screens that contain previews are now maximisable
 * Bug fix: make adding Custom Cave/Tunnel layer floor or roof layers work again (and possibly other nested popups)
 * Various bug fixes

-- Version 2.15.17, released 3-1-2023

 * Data packs can now be specified on the Export screen, which WorldPainter will copy into the datapacks directory of the generated map for you
   + WorldPainter does no validation of these files. In particular, it does not check whether they support the appropriate Minecraft version. Use at your own risk
   + The data packs must be .zip files. Extracted data pack directories are not supported
   + The list of data pack files is stored in the .world file, but the contents of the data packs are not. The data packs must be accessible from the original locations whenever the world is Exported, otherwise a warning will be given and the data pack skipped
   + As part of this work, the Export screen has been redesigned. The general and Minecraft-specific settings are now on their own tab named General
 * The default terrain colour ramp should have topped with purple, but it was actually pink. This has been fixed
 * A setting has been added to the Preferences screen to manually specify the maximum thread count for Export and Merge operations. It is on the Performance tab
   + You can use this to reduce the number of regions Exported or Merged in parallel, to prevent Out Of Memory conditions, or improve performance
   + If an Out Of Memory error occurs, WorldPainter suggests a value to lower this setting to, if it is not already on 1
   + You cannot set the value higher than the number of logical processors (processor cores taking into account hyperthreading etc.) in the system
   + If the org.pepsoft.worldpainter.threads advanced setting is present it overrides this setting. Remove that advanced setting in order to be able to adjust this value in the Preferences
 * Dead bushes can now be planted on grass blocks
 * Bug fix: correct the light levels of the minecraft:light block, and make it insubstantial so that it does not block solid objects
 * Bug fix: prevent an error when rendering very large text with empty lines
 * Bug fix: prevent an error when setting the terrain mode to a colour ramp with a very high default water level
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.16, released 9-12-2022

 * Allow plants to be placed on mud
 * Bug fix: don't delete or corrupt Custom Biomes when switching between dimensions
 * Bug fix: don't crash when a ceiling dimension has tiles where the surface does no
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.15, released 7-12-2022

 * The Custom Layers tab of the Exporting screen now has Enable and Disable buttons to quickly select or deselect all selected layers for Export
 * Bug fix: use correct Custom Biome names when exporting Custom Cave/Tunnel Layers with Floor Dimensions
 * Bug fix: make adding ceiling dimensions to worlds with non-standard build heights work
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.14, released 2-12-2022

 * The Import Mask screen (Edit -> Import -> Mask as terrain or layer...) has been made more powerful and easier to use:
   + Many more mappings are now possible, for example:
     - On/off layers (e.g. Frost or Custom Ground Cover layers) can now be mapped from a grey scale image by dithering or applying a threshold
     - One-bit masks can now be used to set a single terrain type, or an individual value or intensity of any layer
   + Usability has been improved by allowing selection of all layers and values and then restricting the available mappings, or explaining why no mappings are available, rather than restricting the available selections without explanation
 * The Add/Remove Tiles screen now has scrollbars, and additionally is initialised to the same location as the current editor view
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.13, released 23-11-2022

 * Multiple overlay images may now be configured
   + The overlay images are configured from the Configure View screen (View menu, or press Ctrl+V (on Windows) or ⌘+V (on Mac))
   + They can be disabled and enabled separately
   + The existing "Enable or disable image overlay(s)" toolbar button now shows or hides all enabled overlays
     - The exception is if no overlays are enabled. If there is one overlay configured and it is disabled, it will be enabled. In all other cases the Configure View screen will be opened
 * The brush shape, view distance and walking distance indicators are now painted with a black and white dashed line for better visibility
 * Bug fix: cancelling a long running process works correctly again, rather than generating an error
 * Various bug fixes

-- Version 2.15.12, released 20-11-2022

 * A colour and greyscale ramp are now supported for showing the terrain height in the editor, in addition to the existing terrain type and hide terrain options, as an addition or alternative to the contour lines
   + Select the colour or greyscale ramp using the drop down box at the top of the Layers or Terrain panels
     - This does not by itself disable the contour lines. Disable those by pressing the toolbar button, or from the Configure View screen (View menu or Ctrl+V)
   + If you want to see _just_ the colour ramp and no layers, check the Solo checkbox
   + If you also don't want to see water and lava, uncheck the Show checkbox next to Water/Lava
   + The colour ramp adjusts to the minimum and the maximum build heights, and the default water level. It has the following ranges:
     - From -64 to 0: black to blue
     - From 0 to the water level: blue to cyan
     - From the water level to 256: dark green to green to yellow to orange to red to white
     - 256 and up: white to purple
   + The shadows and specular highlights by default will brighten or darken the ramp colours and distort the apparent shape. If you want to disable shadows, press the "Rotate light anticlockwise" button on the toolbar, or the l key, to change the light direction to straight from above and remove the shadows and specular highlights
   + The greyscale ramp can only display 256 values, which is too few for the full build height range of -64 to 320 of a Minecraft 1.18+ map. It is therefore not suitable for detailed editing
   + If there is enough interest more ramps and/or the ability to create custom ramps may be added in the future
 * The mouse cursor is now white with black drop shadows, instead of black, for better visibility
 * The brush shape, view distance and walking distance indicators are now painted in XOR mode (dark over bright background; bright over dark background) for better visibility
 * More diagnostic information has been added to error reports in order to improve debugging of problems
 * Some small bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.11, released 12-11-2022

 * 3D previews now show full details for two additional zoom levels, allowing you to zoom in further before starting to lose precision
 * Bug fix: improve the mapping of WorldPainter materials to Dynmap in order to solve problems of some blocks being invisible and others rendering incorrectly
 * Bug fix: fix the water colour of 3D previews
 * Bug fix: fix a bug in the Dynmap glue code that was causing an error in 3D previews

-- Version 2.15.10, released 11-11-2022

 * The 3D preview for Custom Objects and Custom Layers has been upgraded to use version 3.4 of Dynmap, which supports Minecraft 1.19.2 so there will be fewer unknown blocks rendered as magenta wool
   + There are still some known bugs, such as some log blocks being invisible, fence blocks being rendered with the wrong orientation, etc.. These will be solved in time
   + Dynmap 3.4 includes the vanilla Minecraft textures so the 3D preview no longer needs a Minecraft installation in order to work
 * Selectable colour schemes are once again supported, since Dynmap has reinstated support for them
   + Select a colour scheme from the View menu under "Select colour scheme"
   + The org.pepsoft.worldpainter.colourSchemeFile advanced setting that had been introduced in order to keep being able to load old Dynmap colour schemes is no longer supported and will result in a startup error
 * When creating a new Custom Material on the Configure Cave/Tunnel Layer screen, the other drop down lists are immediately updated so that the new material can be selected for the other choices as well
 * Bug fix: make creating new Custom Materials from the Configure Cave/Tunnel Layer screen work again
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.9, released 8-11-2022

 * Added Minecraft 1.19 as a separate map format
   + For the Minecraft 1.19 format, waterlogged leaf blocks are now supported (in other words leaf blocks on Custom Objects will be placed underwater for Minecraft 1.19 and later)
   + Custom build heights now work for Minecraft 1.19 (including upgrading Minecraft 1.18 maps to 1.19 in Minecraft)
 * Some improvements were made to dimension transformations (scaling, shifting or rotating):
   + The handling of the overlay image, if any, has been fixed and streamlined. It is now adjusted fully automatically, except for rotations (in which case a warning is displayed)
   + All associated dimensions (such as Ceiling dimensions and Custom Cave/Tunnel Floor dimensions) are now automatically included. There is no longer an option to turn that off, since it never makes sense to do so
 * Added a warning and a clearer error message for when a map is being Imported or Merged that has unoptimized, older chunks with different build limits
 * The Preferences screen now enforces that the default theme does not contain Custom Terrains or Custom Layers, as this is suspected to be the cause of errors
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.8, released 3-11-2022

 * Bug fix: fix a crash when Exporting Custom Cave/Tunnel layers with a Floor Dimension
 * Bug fix: show the correct name when clearing a layer from the Global Operations tool
 * Various bug fixes

-- Version 2.15.7, released 29-10-2022

 * If the spawn point is not on the selected tiles for a Test Export, it will automatically temporarily be moved to the middle of the selected area
 * Bug fix: when Merging, don't apply the stored tile selection if "Merge all tiles" is selected
 * Bug fix: when Importing, don't import unfinished chunks that only have biomes in them as empty chunks
   + These chunks occur around the edges of Minecraft 1.18+-generated maps
   + If you have trouble with such incorrect empty chunks around the edges of your imported map, you have two options:
     - Import the map again now that this bug has been fixed
     - Manually remove the Void layer from those chunks, and raise them up to terrain height (they will be at bedrock)
 * Bug fix: schem files with embedded entities no longer result in an error
 * Bug fix: fix an Import error when encountering region files whose size is not a multiple of 4KB
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements

-- Version 2.15.6, released 23-10-2022

 * The Tool Options panel now shows a name and description for the currently selected tool
 * The Height Map Import screen has received some improvements:
   + It is now possible to Import a height map as a Master Dimension to make it easier to create large worlds from scratch based on a height map
   + The preview can now be zoomed in and out by rolling the scroll wheel of the mouse
   + When importing a height map into the current dimension, the current dimension is displayed in the preview to make it easier to position the height map
 * Added a new terrain type: Moss
   + If you have previously Imported maps with moss at the surface, and you want to make changes to those chunks, you need to take action in order that they will Merge correctly:
     - Either re-Import those maps so that the Moss terrain type is present
     - Or manually paint the Moss in the areas it should exist, and raise the terrain to the desired level
 * Andesite, diorite and granite are now Imported as their respective terrain types, rather than the Stone terrain type, so that they are preserved when merging
 * Ores on the surface are now preserved when Merging stone and deepslate. If you want them to be removed you can use the "Remove all resources/ores" Merge option (of course that will remove them from the entire chunk, not just the surface)
 * Various bug fixes

-- Version 2.15.5, released 19-10-2022

 * Combined Layers are now supported for Custom Cave/Tunnel Layer Floor Dimensions. However only if they do not contain prohibited layers for cave floor dimensions, such as cave layers, etc.
 * When editing Floor Dimensions the Floor Dimension is moved into view if it is not currently visible
 * Changed the logic for buried Custom Objects so that they spawn underneath the (ground) water table even if the "under water" spawn option is not checked

-- Version 2.15.4, released 17-10-2022

 * Custom Objects layers have gained some additional choices for the vertical placement of objects:
   + They can now be placed at a fixed absolute height, rather than relative to the terrain
   + They can be offset above or below the terrain by a fixed positive or negative value
   + A random vertical variation can be added in either case to displace the object randomly below or above the initial position
   + The spawn settings are still taken into account! If you want the objects to float in the air, make sure that spawn "on air" is selected
   + Each of these settings can be configured individually per object. To change them for all objects at once, select all the objects and press the Edit button
 * Bug fix: fix an error caused by Exporting a Custom Cave/Tunnel Layer Floor Dimension with custom terrains and no biomes
 * Bug fix: make the Stained Terracotta menu work again for Only On and Except On on the Brush Settings panel
 * Various bug fixes

-- Version 2.15.3, released 16-10-2022

 * Master Dimensions are now also supported for Merging
 * Bug fix: restore the wall width behaviour of the previous major release for Custom Cave/Tunnel Layers (even though that is in fact wrong)
 * Bug fix: place the spawn point and goodies chest correctly if they are on a Master Dimension

-- Version 2.15.2, released 15-10-2022

 * Bug fix: make the Custom Layers tab on the Export screen work again
 * Bug fix: show the Custom Layers from the correct dimension on the Custom Layers tab, not the dimension that is currently being edited
 * Bug fix: render all Custom Biomes correctly
 * Bug fix: fix a crash that sometimes occurred when adding Custom Biomes

-- Version 2.15.1, released 14-10-2022

 * Bug fix: fix a crash that occurred when Exporting a Custom Cave/Tunnel Layer with manually painted biomes on the Floor Dimension
 * Bug fix: prevent an error when changing the map format from the Export screen
 * Bug fix: fix a crash that occurred when test-Exporting or Merging a world with a tile selection

-- Version 2.15.0, released 14-10-2022

 * Large World Support through Master Dimensions [ALPHA]
   + This functionality is in Alpha status; it is unfinished and has known and unknown bugs, lacking features, usability problems, etc. Please report these as you find them
   + This feature is meant to make it faster and easier to create large maps with large featureless areas
   + Master Dimensions are a new WorldPainter dimension type (comparable to Ceiling Dimensions) that are exported at sixteen times the horizontal size, wherever a regular dimension does not exist. It is a scaled-up "background" dimension
   + Since it is scaled up sixteen times on Export it does not allow for any detailed work, just crude, large-scale forms and shapes
   + This makes it ideal for quickly creating large, featureless areas such as oceans, continents, islands, deserts, ice shelves, etc.
   + It can contain any kind of layer, allowing the quick creation of large forests or other areas of vegetation, cave systems, etc.
   + Because it is edited at 16:1 scale, it is _much_ faster to create, edit, save and load and takes up much less memory and disk space
   + Exporting still takes the same amount of time though
   + A Master Dimension can be created in two ways:
     - On an existing world you can select Edit -> Dimensions -> Add master dimension...
     - You can create a new world as a Master Dimension from scratch by checking "create as master dimension" on the Create New World screen
   + To switch from the Master to the regular dimension to paint the 1:1 details:
     - If you are currently in the Master dimension, switch to the regular dimension by pressing Ctrl+M
     - Then press Ctrl+T to add tiles to the regular dimension (this may happen automatically if there are no tiles yet)
     - The master dimension is displayed in the background as you select new tiles, and the tiles will be created following the shape, terrain and layers of the Master dimension in that location
   * Most aspects that apply to an entire Minecraft dimension, such as border settings, Minecraft settings, "this layer everywhere" settings, etc. are controlled by the regular dimension and cannot be changed in the settings of the Master dimension
 * Custom Cave Floor Dimensions [ALPHA]
   + This functionality is in Alpha status; it is unfinished and has known and unknown bugs, lacking features, usability problems, etc. Please report these as you find them
   + Custom Cave/Tunnel Layers now have a fourth floor type: Custom Dimension, that allows you to completely customise the floor height, shape and type, and contents of the cave
   + Custom Cave/Tunnel Floor Dimensions are a new WorldPainter dimension type (comparable to Ceiling Dimensions) that allow you to completely customise the height, shape and terrain type of the cave floor, as well as the biomes and layers in any shapes you wish
   + The Floor Dimension only controls the vertical shape of the cave floor. The horizontal shape of the cave is still controlled by painting the Custom Cave/Tunnel Layer on the surface dimension
   + To edit the Floor Dimension, after painting the horizontal shape of the cave on the surface, right-click on the layer button and select "Edit floor dimension"
     - To stop editing the Floor Dimension, press Esc, or switch to the surface dimension by pressing Ctrl+U (Minecraft Surface), Ctrl+H (Nether) or Ctrl+D (End)
   + While editing the Floor Dimension, cross hatching indicates where the floor level is higher than the roof level (so that the cave will not exist in those areas)
   + For now, layers that operate below the cave floor or above its roof are not allowed (such as other cave layers, Custom Underground Pockets laters, etc.). This may be added in the future
   + For now, only the floor can be customised this way. A similar custom roof dimension may be added in the future. For now you can still use the existing Roof Layers support to add layers randomly on the roof
 * Custom Cave/Tunnel Layers have also gained a new roof level type: Fixed Height Above Floor
   + This is now the default roof level type, and it works well with the new Custom Dimension floor type
 * The Populate layer is now also supported for Merging. When Merging a world on which the Populate layer is painted, those chunks will once again be marked as unpopulated, thereby requesting Minecraft to populate them when first loading them
   + This may not work, or work properly, with every Minecraft version. Experiment to find out
   + If there is already vegetation there the results may be unexpected or incorrect. But at your option you can use WorldPainter's Merge settings to remove the existing vegetation in the merged chunks
   + Consider marking _all_ chunks Read Only and then only removing the Read Only layer from the chunks you want to be affected. This will protect the rest of the map _and_ speed up the Merge
 * The show and solo state of palettes is now remembered when saving and loading worlds and switching dimensions
   + This does _not_ extend to the show and solo state of individual layers
 * The workspace layout is now remembered per dimension rather than per world
   + This includes the currently active palettes, so that they will still be active when you return to the dimension
   + All currently stored per-world layouts will be reset; you will have to re-do your workspace layout once per world
   + You can speed this up by storing your favourite workspace layout as the default using View -> Workspace layout -> Save workspace layout; this will be used as the default for every world you subsequently create or open
 * Various usability improvements

-- Version 2.14.6, released 10-10-2022

 * The performance and readability of the Text tool screen has been improved. Instead of rendering the names in the Font drop-down in the respective fonts, the font of the text area is changed to the selected font
   + Note that the selected size is not applied to the text area, to keep it readable when selecting very small or very large sizes
 * It is no longer possible to delete a Custom Terrain if it is still in use in a Combined Layer
 * Bug fix: once again allow importing Combined Layers with an embedded Custom Terrain from a file
 * Bug fix: fix some data corruption issues related to merging with Minecraft 1.15 - 1.16 maps
 * Bug fix: make merging biomes work again for Minecraft 1.15 - 1.16

-- Version 2.14.5, released 30-9-2022

 * Some improvements have been made to Combined Layers:
   + By default they now apply the configured terrain and/or biome on Export, rather than when painted
   + It is now possible to edit the settings of any Custom Layers contained in the Combined Layer directly from the layer's settings screen
   + The layer preview has been fixed and improved
 * Various bug fixes

-- Version 2.14.4, released 24-9-2022

 * When selecting tiles (for adding/removing, or for Exporting), dragging will now select all the tiles (rather than invert the selection). To deselect tiles, hold Ctrl or Command while dragging
 * Some improvements in error handling
 * Bug fix: scale About screen properly on high-res monitors
 * Various bug fixes

-- Version 2.14.3, released 17-9-2022

 * Some window sizes have been adjusted in order to make them fit on low resolution screens more often (but still not always)
 * Bug fix: change grass_block blocks to dirt when they are covered by dirt_path or grass_path blocks
 * Various other bug fixes

-- Version 2.14.1, released 9-9-2022

 * Bug fix: fix an error when trying to Merge a world that has no export setings set

-- Version 2.14.0, released 9-9-2022

 * Fast test exports have been made easier with the addition of a Test Export button to the Export screen
   + The tile selection has been moved to the new Test Export screen
   + The Export button now always exports everything
   + You don't have to select tiles; you can also export one entire dimension; by default just the Surface dimension is selected for export
   + In addition, on this new screen you can control some features that are slow to export and are not always necessary, e.g. resources, caves and the lighting pass
   + By default all those features are turned off, for the fastest test exports
   + The test settings are remembered between exports
 * Plants will now be placed on mod blocks by Custom Plants layers, and not be removed from mod blocks during post-processing
   + This also covers plants placed by Custom Objects layers
 * In addition, two new settings will allow plants to optionally be placed on ALL blocks:
   + On the Post Processing tab of the Export screen, removal of plants from invalid blocks can now be turned off
     - This applies to plants placed with Custom Plants layers (but see below), or with Custom Object layers
     - Of course this makes it your responsibility to ensure that plants are placed only on the correct blocks!
   + Custom Plants layers now have an "only on valid blocks" setting which you can turn off
     - Turning it off will place plants on any block, but water plants will still not be placed on dry land and vice versa
     - You also need to change the post-processing setting described above, otherwise the post-processing step will remove the plants after all. WorldPainter will remind you of this when you turn the setting off

-- Version 2.13.3, released 27-8-2022

 * Bug fix: make undo work properly again for ceiling dimensions

-- Version 2.13.2, released 25-8-2022

 * Scripting: reintroduce World2.getDimension(int) method (but deprecated) so existing scripts keep working
 * Plugins: support platforms without export settings

-- Version 2.13.1, released 23-8-2022

 * Bug fix: work around a bug in Java which was causing non-surface dimensions to overwrite the surface dimension upon loading existing .world files
   + If you have saved such a .world file after loading it with the surface being missing, that change is now permanent! You will have to load a backup of the .world file. Apologies for the inconvenience
 * Bug fix: export the Large Biomes world type correctly for Minecraft 1.17, preventing an error upon loading such maps in Minecraft
 * Add a toolbar button for scaling the dimension
 * Support the Populate layer in the theme settings
 * Loading the custom block definition files introduced in version 2.11 has been made more forgiving
   + An error in the file no longer caused the WorldPainter configuration to be reset
   + All columns but "name" have been made optional. If you leave out the column (or individual values), WorldPainter will make a crude guess
 * Bug fix: make the Amplified world type work for more Minecraft versions
 * Various other small bug fixes

-- Version 2.13.0, released 20-8-2022

 * Scaling (resizing) the world is now supported!
   + The new Scale screen can be reached from the Edit menu or the Global Operations tool
   + This is new and relatively untested functionality. Please save your work first, carefully examine the results and report any problems you encounter
   + Each dimension is scaled separately, but ceiling dimensions can automatically be scaled along with their associated surface dimension
   + Just like rotating and shifting, scaling cannot be undone! In addition, if you are scaling up and do not have enough memory, the operation may fail and result in loss of tiles! Please save your work first
   + Scaling can result in artefacts, especially at larger scales. This is especially true for terrain type and discrete layers such as Annotations, which are scaled with nearest neighbour interpolation and will become blocky
   + If the resulting world edges don't fall on chunk boundaries, scaling may result in land being added along the edges
 * When selecting an endless border it is once again made clear that this changes the world type to Superflat, and thereby makes Populate not work
 * For new installations on UNIX/Linux systems the location of the configuration directory now follows the XDG specification
 * Bug fix: fix a number of problems with Exporting entities (this includes mobs, but also things like paintings) from Custom Objects
   + NOTE: it may be necessary to reload objects from disk from the Custom Object layer's settings screen, before they will behave correctly on Export
   + Most notably, offsets and random rotation and mirroring should now work correctly for entities. However entity attitudes and poses are stored by Minecraft in extremely varied and inconsistent ways, so it may still not be the case for all of them. Please report entities that are still not Exported correctly when offset, rotated or mirrored
 * Bug fix: fix an error that occurred when Merging changes in terrain height to maps with 3D biomes
 * Bug fix: the new Mud terrain type has been added to terrain selection lists
 * Bug fix: the preview of Custom Object layers is now updated after changing the properties of individual Custom Objects
 * Bug fix: Exporting a dimension with a ceiling dimension that has missing tiles will no longer result in an error

-- Version 2.12.0, released 2-8-2022

 * Added support for Minecraft 1.19 blocks, plants and biomes
 * Random mirroring for Custom Objects is now a separate setting from random rotation. They are still both on by default (unless random rotation is turned off in the bo2 or bo3 file). Depending on what properties a block has, mirroring blocks works by rotating them 180 degrees, and for some mod blocks this does not give the desired result because their rotated versions are not mirrors of the original blocks
 * Unsupported biome IDs from modded maps are now warned about and ignored during Imports, rather than resulting in an error
 * Merge and Import warnings are now always immediately displayed, rather than asking the user to view them
 * Bug fix: when Importing a map, finished but empty chunks are no longer skipped. This could cause problems if the world was subsequently Exported, as Minecraft would generate new chunks in those locations
 * Bug fix: fix a crash that happened when Exporting a world with certain layers on a ceiling dimension

-- Version 2.11.0, released 24-7-2022

 * Added support for custom/mod block definitions:
   + Have mod blocks be correctly lighted, and behave correctly during Exports and Merges
   + More easily use mod blocks as custom materials (choose from a list, and have the properties be preconfigured)
   + Have mod blocks be displayed in the right colour in the editor view
   + For details, see: https://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/CustomBlocks
   + If you are a mod author, please create custom block definition files for your mods! If not, ask the authors of your favourite mods to create ones, or create them yourself!
 * The snowy property of grass blocks is now also set correctly for powder snow

-- Version 2.10.14, released 20-7-2022

 * The Merging screen has been improved:
   + The layout has been made more clear
   + It is once again possible to replace the biomes. For formats with 3D biomes this can now be done separately above ground and below ground
   + Biome replacing is now integrated in the other forms of merging and consequently now conforms to the tile selection and the Read Only layer. It is still faster to _only_ replace biomes though because the post processing and lighting steps are skipped
   + The merge settings are now remembered per world
 * Fix a problem in the updater which would cause downloads to fail after first checking the update comments. This will no longer happen starting from the _next_ update
 * Running JavaScript scripts requires at least Java 11; a popup will now be shown to indicate this, rather than crashing with an error
 * If rendering a tile in the 3D view fails for some reason, for example because it is too large for very high worlds, it will be rendered as a red outline rather than crashing with an error
 * Various usability improvements
 * Various small bug fixes

-- Version 2.10.13, released 14-7-2022

 * Bug fix: don't remove upper halves of tall seagrass during post processing

-- Version 2.10.12, released 11-7-2022

 * Bug fix: set the button states correctly when opening the Tile Selection screen
 * Bug fix: more thoroughly prevent UI errors on Java 17 or higher

-- Version 2.10.11, released 27-6-2022

 * Support Importing Minecraft 1.19 maps
 * Replace deepslate ores with deepslate rather than stone when removing resources while Merging
 * Various small improvements
 * Bug fix: prevent an error while handling key presses on Java 17 or higher

-- Version 2.10.10, released 2-6-2022

 * Make smooth ground cover layers (see `smoothGroundCover` on https://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/AdvancedSettings for details) work again with Minecraft 1.2 - 1.12
 * Bug fix: fix a few export errors related to the new cave decoration functionality
 * Bug fix: fix an export error related to removing incomplete double-high plants during post processing

-- Version 2.10.9, released 31-5-2022

 * Custom Objects marked for placement "on water" now have an additional option to control whether they will be placed if they collide with the floor of the body of water
 * Cave decoration changes:
   + Lush cave patches are now larger
   + Lush cave patches now occur at all heights
     - NOTE that for existing worlds you may have to turn the lush cave patches decoration setting off and on again to see the change
   + Dripstone cave patches now place dripstone blocks around the stalagmites and stalactites
 * Make exporting tile selections for large worlds more efficient
 * Improve lighting of sea_pickles, slabs and stairs
 * Remove unsupported water plants during post processing
 * Bug fix: detect azalea leaves as leaf blocks
 * Bug fix: fix an export error for chunk sections with a large number of biomes
 * Bug fix: in scripts, make applyLayer() work without having to specify a heightmap
 * Bug fix: don't create duplicate start menu/desktop icons for WorldPainter in .deb and .rpm installers

-- Version 2.10.8, released 28-5-2022

 * Warn when loading an old world with invalid Superflat preset, rather than giving an error
 * Bug fix: covered dirt_path blocks are now turned to dirt during post processing
 * Bug fix: dirt_path blocks are now correctly lighted
 * Some bug fixes concerning loading very old worlds

-- Version 2.10.7, released 25-5-2022

 * Bug fix: fixed a bug in the new cave decoration settings that sometimes caused errors or prevented WorldPainter from starting

-- Version 2.10.6, released 25-5-2022

 * A new Decorate option has been added to the Caves, Caverns and Chasms layers, which can add random decorations to the generated caves of the following types:
   + Brown mushrooms (on by default)
   + Glow lichen (on by default)
   + Patches of Lush Cave (off by default; stone will turn to moss, lush cave plants will be planted and the biome will be set to lush_caves)
   + Patches of Dripstone Cave (off by default; dripstone stalagmites and stalactites will be generated and the biome will be set to dripstone_caves)
   + These last two are still in beta. Please give feedback
 * The Import process now skips chunks when their data is corrupted, rather than aborting
 * Various bug fixes and usability improvements
 * Bug fix: fix two separate scripting bugs that stopped filters from working in general, and filtering on biomes in particular

-- Version 2.10.5, released 18-5-2022

 * Bug fix: fix some over enthusiastic post processing that removed blocks with a "half: up" or "half: down" property
 * Bug fix: correct a random number generation problem that was resulting in Custom Object and Custom Plants layers not being rendered with the correct distribution as Custom Cave/Tunnel floor and roof layers

-- Version 2.10.4, released 17-5-2022

 * Water plants are now supported for Custom Cave/Tunnel floor and roof layers
 * Bug fix: more correct calulation and storage of sky light values
 * Bug fix: support schem files that don't have metadata
 * Bug fix: correct the block light emited by glow lichen

-- Version 2.10.3, released 15-5-2022

 * A new Barrier border type has been added, in addition to the previously added Barrier wall type
 * When the Barrier wall type is used the word type is no longer forced to Superflat and no endless Void is generated beyond the wall. This means the Minecraft-generated land beyond it will be visible; to prevent that the new Barrier border can be used instead, which can be made to be much wider (or endless)
 * Bug fix: don't treat negative numbers on the wpscript command line as options
 * Bug fix: fix rare error when clearing blocks from the existing map during a Merge

-- Version 2.10.2, released 14-5-2022

 * In addition to the existing Bedrock wall option it is now also possible to create Barrier block walls
   + In addition, a "roof" option has been added, that will cover the map with a one block layer of Bedrock or Barrier blocks at the top. Together these options can completely box players in
   + NOTE that a bedrock roof will make the map dark, but it won't darken the sky or hide the sun
   + When the Barrier wall is selected, outside the walls will be fixed to endless Void
 * WorldPainter now tries harder to spawn you at the terrain level, rather than on top of the roof or the ceiling dimension
   + This does mean that if your spawn location is blocked, you might suffocate
   + It is not guaranteed to work for multiplayer
 * Bug fix: fix an export crash when terrain near the build limit contains plants that go over it

-- Version 2.10.1, released 13-5-2022

 * Bug fix: fix an error when opening Cave/Tunnel Layer settings that have a Plant layer as floor or roof layer that was saved with a different version
 * Bug fix: fix an error during Merging when the height difference between the world and the existing map is large

-- Version 2.10.0, released 13-5-2022

 * WorldPainter now has a merch store! Go to https://www.worldpainter.store/ to support WorldPainter development
 * Custom Caves/Tunnel layer new functionality:
   + The Custom Caves/Tunnel layer now supports roof layers in addition to floor layers
   + Note that the roof layers are inverted. This includes Custom Objects, so you will have to make any objects you want to place on the roof upside-down (unless you _want_ them to be upside-down of course). A future version will make this inversion optional for Custom Object layers
   + The variation of Custom Caves/Tunnel floor and roof layers can now be configured, so that they are not applied with the same intensity everywhere but can vary randomly
   + The hanging plants have been added to the Custom Plants layer, for use as Cave/Tunnel roof layers. They will work non-inverted as well, but of course they will be upside-down
 * All known Minecraft 1.18 materials and material properties have been added the the custom material selector, so they can be more easily used in Custom Terrains, Custom Materials, etc...
 * Custom Layer palettes now have a "show" and "solo" checkbox for the entire palette, making it a little easier to show or hide entire categories of layers:
   + Unchecking "show" will hide all the layers from that palette from the editor view. It will be indicated by changing the palette icon to a red cross
   + Checking "solo" will only show the layers from that palette in the editor view. If will be indicated by changing the palette icon to a green checkmark. Soloing takes precedence over turning off "show". Only one palette can be soloed at a time
   + Just like with showing or soloing individual layers, all the layers will still be Exported
   + Soloing a single layer takes precedence over soloing a palette
   + If you have a paint tool selected, the currently selected paint is always shown, regardless of the show and solo settings
 * The Grass and Beaches terrain types now also place seagrass seagrass and kelp under water
 * The Small Dripleaf plant has been added to the Custom Plants layer
 * The Frost layer now also turns water blocks with plants in them to ice, and removes the remains of the plant above, if any
 * Importing signed integer height maps is now supported
 * WorldPainter now calculates the "distance" property of leaf blocks while Exporting. This may help prevent leaf blocks that should not decay from decaying in-game. This can be turned off on the Post Processing tab
   + WorldPainter can also automatically remove leaf blocks that are too distant (and not persistent) and would decay in Minecraft. This is turned off by default but can be turned on on the Post Processing tab
   + There is also an option to make all leaf blocks persistent (even those placed by the WorldPainter tree layers or in other ways which are normally not persistent)
 * Importing maps with custom dimension types or world types now works. Note that you can't edit these settings and WorldPainter will still only Import the vanilla Surface, Nether and End dimensions
 * The performance of the 3D view has been significantly improved for very large worlds
 * Various small bug fixes and usability/performance improvements
 * Bug fix: fixed a visual glitch in the 3D view
 * Bug fix: fix lighting of blocks that give off light

-- Version 2.9.7, released 9-5-2022

 * Allow Custom Cave/Tunnel floor layer minimum levels to go below zero

-- Version 2.9.6, released 9-5-2022

 * Bug fix: fix a regression in the Minecraft 1.17 support that was generating invalid datapacks for deviating build heights

-- Version 2.9.5, released 6-5-2022

 * The Moss Block material is now considered a solid block, rather than insubstantial vegetation
 * Bug fix: fix an error that prevented the creation of Custom Underground Pockets layers

-- Version 2.9.4, released 5-5-2022

 * Bug fix: fix a startup problem related to the UI scale setting
 * Bug fix: make Safe Mode disable UI scaling, as should already have been the case
 * Bug fix: make importing a height map into an existing dimension work again

-- Version 2.9.3, released 4-5-2022

 * World types are now properly supported for Minecraft 1.17, making endless borders work among other things
 * A "Resources everywhere" checkbox has been added to the Preferences screen, in order to be able to turn off "Resources everywhere" by default
 * The GraalVM JavaScript engine has been switched out for Nashorn, which is faster. This does mean that if you want to run scripts you need to run WorldPainter on Java 11 or higher
 * Various small bug fixes

-- Version 2.9.2, released 3-5-2022

 * The Preferences screen now allows to configure the default map format, and the default post processing settings
 * The status bar, info panel, brush settings and Global Operations tool now all show the correct biome names according to the map format
 * Floating point height maps are not yet supported; this is now made clearer with an error message when trying to load one
 * The view distance for the view distance indicator circle is now set to 12 chunks (the default render distance of Minecraft 1.18.2)
 * Bug fix: prevent an error while importing height maps if the default theme has previously been saved with values which are now invalid
 * Bug fix: show only valid build limits for the map format on the Preferences screen to prevent a crash on startup if it is set to an invalid value

-- Version 2.9.1, released 2-5-2022

 * Added Calcite as terrain type
 * Reinstated Water and Lava terrain types, with clearer tool tips. Don't use these (especially Water); you probably want the Flood or Lava tool
 * Bug fix: exporting border chunks no longer causes an error about Populate not being supported
 * Bug fix: calculating the lighting of a Void chunk no longer causes an error
 * Bug fix: when creating a Custom Terrain Type, properly save the custom name and update the terrain name when pressing Enter or OK without leaving the custom name field

-- Version 2.9.0, released 1-5-2022

 * The Minecraft 1.18 map format is now supported
   + This includes negative heights down to y=-64
   + The map format of worlds must now be explicitly set and changed (rather than implicitly on the Export screen). There is a new entry in the Edit menu for this: "Change Map Format...". It allows you to change the map format, and make any required height changes at the same time
   + The Stone Mix material (the default underground material) now places deep slate and pockets of tuff under y=0
   + Minecraft 1.18 (and earlier) plants have been added to the Custom Plants layer. Hanging plants are still missing, as it is not clear how WorldPainter would place those
   + Minecraft 1.18 (and earlier) terrain types and biomes have been added to the various palettes
   + The Populate layer (and the Allow Minecraft to Populate the Entire Terrain option on the Export screen) are once again supported by Minecraft from version 1.18, so those have been re-enabled. It allows you to tell Minecraft to populate the terrain with trees, vegetation, etc. according to the painted biome
   + The "chest of goodies" is once again supported for Minecraft 1.18 (and all other Minecraft versions)
 * Entities (mobs) and tile entities (block entities) from Custom Objects are once again correctly placed on the map
   + NOTE: for entities (mobs), you may have to remove and re-add the Custom Object to the layer for this to work
 * When Importing an existing map, or Merging with an existing map, the map directory should now be selected, rather than the level.dat file
 * Nether and End dimension changes:
   + The world type can now be configured for Nether and End dimensions
   + The Nether and End dimensions can now have Endless Borders, which will have Nether and End biomes respectively
   + The build heights of Nether and End dimensions are constrained to a low of 0 and high of 255, regardless of those of the Surface dimension, since those are the allowed build heights in those dimensions in Minecraft
 * The Custom Cave/Tunnel layer now supports setting the biome inside the cave/tunnel to a different one than the surface. This works for Minecraft 1.17 and Minecraft 1.18+
 * 32-bit height maps are now supported for both Import and Export
   + Note that they *must* be TIFF files; PNG does not support 32-bit grey scale images
   + The height map import screen has been improved to be easier to use; among other things it now offers presets to quickly set the mapping
 * Merging biomes now takes the tile selection and the Read-Only layer into account, and the performance has been improved
 * The default theme no longer uses the Rock terrain type. Rock includes cobblestone, which is not Imported and caused confusion as a result. Instead it uses Stone Mix (the default underground material), which makes more sense
 * The Flood With Water, Flood With Lava and Bucket Fill tools now work on very large maps
   + They will take a very long time to fill large areas (up to ten minutes or more)
   + Undoing or redoing such large operations may also take a very long time and should not be interrupted
   + There is a maximum size for the area that can be filled: a square with sides of 46340 blocks. The tools will only fill up to the edges of this square and warn you if they were hit
 * Various improvements to Custom Brushes:
   +  Custom brushes are now no longer all loaded at startup
     - This prevents performance problems and WorldPainter hanging at startup due to the use of many and/or large custom brushes taking up too much memory
     - The brushes are now loaded "lazily" (on-demand). This does mean that selecting a brush, or using one after it has not been used for a while, may take a small performance hit as it (re-)loads the brush from disk
   + The tab icons by default are now the first letter of the folder the brushes are in
   + You can override the icon for each folder by putting a file named "icon.png" in it
 * Various small usability improvements and performance optimisations have been made
 * Various measures to prevent data corruption and other problems due to lack of disk space were implemented:
   + When Exporting or Merging maps:
     - If there is less than a configurable amount of free space (5 GB by default), WorldPainter will offer to delete backups, oldest first, until the minimum amount of free space is reached
     - WorldPainter tries to ensure that at least one backup remains of every map for as long as possible, but if there is not enough space for that it will delete backups of maps for which there is only one backup left
     - This measure can be disabled, or the limit changed from the default of 5 GB, on the Preferences screen. It is also possible to manually trigger a backups clean up from there
   + When Saving .world files:
     - The file is saved to a temporary file first, so that if that fails (e.g. because the disk is full) the existing file, if any, is not corrupted
 * Colour Schemes for the editor, that allowed for different colours for materials, are no longer supported and have been removed
 * Scripting changes:
   + The GraalVM JavaScript engine is now included, so that scripts implemented in JavaScript will always be supported, even on newer Oracle runtimes which lack JavaScript support
   + When creating new worlds from height maps in scripts the platform (map format) can now be specified
 * Mac OS X binaries are now universal binaries so that they will use the native M1 version of Java on M1 Macs for improved performance
 * Various bugs have been fixed

-- Version 2.8.10, released 11-12-2021

 * Add support for data pack format 7 to prevent errors when importing maps using them
 * Bug fix: allow selection of 320 blocks map height when importing height maps
 * Bug fix: properly drop lava in post processing step

-- Version 2.8.9, released 9-12-2021

 * Bug fix: fix water and lava dropping to stop at existing water or lava (and not obliterate plants)
 * Bug fix: also place water plants in one block deep water

-- Version 2.8.8, released 9-12-2021

 * Bug fix: attempt to fix an error Importing maps using data packs using an uncommon ZIP format
 * Bug fix: make Custom Object Layer previews work again without errors
 * Bug fix: fix various errors during Export caused by the new flowing water support

-- Version 2.8.7, released 8-12-2021

 * It is now possible to change the post processing settings to have WorldPainter handle floating fluids and other blocks in various ways. This is done from the new Post Processing tab on the Export screen:
   + For both water and lava you can configure:
     - Whether floating blocks should be extended downwards until they hit a solid block
     - Whether uncontained blocks should be turned into flowing water or lava so that Minecraft will cause them to flow out upon loading
   + For sand, gravel and cement (separately):
     - Whether floating blocks should be left floating, supported by turning the lowermost block into stone or sandstone, or be dropped down on a solid block underneath

-- Version 2.8.6, released 6-12-2021

 * Bug fix: make custom layer previews work without errors by correctly filling the 3D biomes up to the level height

-- Version 2.8.5, released 5-12-2021

 * Bug fix: make the Preferences screen work again

-- Version 2.8.4, released 5-12-2021

 * The Minecraft 1.15+ format is now the default format for new worlds
 * Add experimental support for Minecraft 1.17 with increased build heights up to 2032 (although higher than 320 is not recommended for performance reasons)
   - Note that Minecraft 1.18 CANNOT load such maps! Minecraft 1.18 *can* load maps that were exported in Minecraft 1.15+ format. WorldPainter cannot yet Import maps from Minecraft 1.18
   - If you set the build height to 320 (the default), you will later be able to export the map in Minecraft 1.18 format, once support is added to WorldPainter
 * Bug fixes: a range of frequent errors has been fixed, including but not limited to:
   - The Text tool now works with all layers
   - The Flood tool no longer causes errors when invoked repeatedly
   - Errors attempting to show a progress bar in the Windows task bar
   - Importing and Exporting of maps with a non standard world type (it will be reset to the default world type), or Superflat presets without structures
   - The Populate layer can now be obtained from scripts

-- Version 2.8.3, released 6-11-2021

 * Implement a workaround for Importing maps that had previously been Exported with incorrect biome IDs due to the bug fixed in version 2.8.2

-- Version 2.8.2, released 5-11-2021

 * Bug fix: correctly export biomes with ID's higher than 127 in Minecraft 1.15+ format

-- Version 2.8.1, released 28-5-2021

 * Make it work on Java 16.
 * Bug fix: allow dead shrubs to be planted on dirt, podzol and coarse dirt

-- Version 2.8.0, released 18-04-2021

 * Biomes are now correctly Imported and Exported for Minecraft 1.15+
   - This solves the striped biomes when Importing Minecraft 1.15+ maps
   - This means the minimum supported post-1.12 version of Minecraft is now 1.15
   - Minecraft 1.15 biomes are stored in 4x4x4 chunks. You can still edit them at block level (as Minecraft 1.12 still stores them at block level) but they will be "rounded of" to 4x4 areas when Exported
   - WorldPainter does not yet support 3D biomes. The biome at ground level is Imported, and applied top to bottom when Exporting or Merging
 * Biome editing is now also enabled for the Nether and End dimensions
 * Improvements to the Caves layer:
   - Better shape (no single block extrusions)
   - Flooding with water or lava works
   - Better removal of floating blocks

-- Version 2.7.18, released 27-12-2020

 * Bug fix: blocks covered by snow are once again correctly made snowy
 * Bug fix: don't place snow on Grass Path blocks
 * Detect missing custom terrain types on loading and replace them with magenta wool; try to prevent this situation from occurring in the future by clearing the undo buffer after removing a custom terrain type
 * Rename Permadirt to Coarse Dirt

-- Version 2.7.17, released 9-8-2020

 * Fix the errors that occurred when Importing Minecraft 1.16 maps. (PLEASE NOTE: otherwise no support has yet been added for new block types, etc.)
 * Automatic UI scaling on high resolution monitors is now constrained to between 100% and 200% to prevent excesses
 * The cross hair mouse cursor is now correctly scaled on high resolution monitors

-- Version 2.7.16, released 14-6-2020

 * Work around a bug in the docking framework that stopped the scrollbars from working

-- Version 2.7.15, released 12-6-2020

 * Allow Importing from and Merging with maps with corrupted chunks. Of course this may result in damaged and/or missing chunks!
 * Grass blocks and other blocks that should not exist under water are now correctly turned to dirt underneath water plants
 * Bug fix: tools no longer stop working on Macs after pressing modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, etc.)
 * Bug fix: once again place water plants from the Custom Plants layer and Custom Object layers

-- Version 2.7.14, released 7-6-2020

 * Don't try to place vines from custom objects under water
 * Bug fix: make the Fill tool work with continuous layers again

-- Version 2.7.13, released 6-6-2020

 * More robust prevention of unwanted autosaves and uncommanded operations

-- Version 2.7.12, released 5-6-2020

 * Bug fix: fix intermittent sticking operations in legacy mouse mode

-- Version 2.7.11, released 5-6-2020

 * Improved error reporting: detailed diagnostic information is now sent directly to the WorldPainter server when an error occurs, rather than relying on email. This will hopefully help with prioritising errors better and fixing them sooner. If "send usage information" is turned on, error reports will be sent automatically. If it is off, you will be asked to click the Send Report button explicitly in order to send the error details to the WorldPainter server. If sending the information automatically fails, you will still be asked to email the information, or use the "copy to clipboard" button
 * Attempt to avoid operations becoming stuck if an autosave or other interruption happens while one is active. Autosaves should not happen at all while an operation is being applied, but at least hopefully if it does it will not result in the operation getting stuck and continue applying unwanted changes. Please let me know if that still happens!
 * Bug fix: don't increase the size of the main window repeatedly when starting WorldPainter on a hi-dpi monitor

-- Version 2.7.10, released 17-5-2020

 * Bug fix: fix a bug introduced in the previous version that prevented the loading of worlds

-- Version 2.7.9, released 17-5-2020

 * Added support for the Bamboo Jungle biome
 * Expanded support for Importing older Minecraft 1.13+ maps by solving an error with byte-valued biome maps
 * Don't scale the UI in Safe Mode, allowing it to be used for fixing UI scaling problems
 * Bug fix: properly report the size of the map when Importing an existing Minecraft map

-- Version 2.7.8, released 5-5-2020

 * Superflat preset editing has been re-enabled (but is not very useful for Minecraft 1.14+ maps as Minecraft will not apply it to the generated chunks; it will only affect Minecraft-generated chunks outside the generated map)
 * The Importing and Merging of water and water related blocks has been improved in various small ways. This should fix holes in the water after Importing or missing blocks after Merging
 * Some small further improvements in UI scaling
 * Don't scale the UI in Safe Mode. This allows you to disable it if UI scaling turns out to cause problems on your operating system
 * Bug fix: the height map import preview broke importing height maps into existing worlds; this has been fixed

-- Version 2.7.7, released 24-4-2020

 * High resolution displays are better supported. WorldPainter should now scale its UI automatically according to your operating system setting. You can also adjust the UI scale manually on the Preferences screen. Note that visual themes are only supported at 100% scale
 * When importing height maps a preview of the selected settings is now displayed, to make it easier to judge the result and faster to experiment with settings
 * Custom Terrains can now be deleted, once they are no longer in use, by right-clicking on them and selecting "Remove...". If they are still in use, first use the Global Operations tool to replace them with another terrain type (by using "fill with terrain type" and "only on")
 * Coral blocks now count as solid blocks, solving some issues with using them in custom objects under water
 * Bug fix: when a custom terrain type is missing from a .world file this is now correctly reported, instead of generating a secondary error

-- Version 2.7.6, released 5-4-2020

 * Bug fix: fix a compilation error that had inadvertently been introduced when re-releasing version 2.7.5 and which broke 3D object previews

-- Version 2.7.5, released 1-12-2019

 * Improvement in managing the "waterlogged" property of Minecraft 1.14 blocks, to prevent air pockets under water. Please keep letting me know of instances where blocks are inappropriately waterlogged, or not waterlogged
 * Bug fix: fix an export error that could occur with Chasms or Caverns that reach all the way to the top of the map

-- Version 2.7.4, released 20-10-2019

 * Add support for tile entities in schem files
 * Silently skip out of bounds non-empty sections when importing Minecraft 1.14 maps (the dreaded "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 16" error). This should allow more maps to be imported successfully, but depending on what is in these sections the map may not be imported completely

-- Version 2.7.3, released 12-9-2019

 * Bug fix: don't display an error message while creating the preview for a Custom Ground Cover layer with a modern material
 * Bug fix: don't choke on Importing Minecraft 1.14 maps in which Minecraft has created out of bounds empty sections above or below the map
 * Bug fix: Import bubble columns correctly as water

-- Version 2.7.2, released 11-9-2019

 * Bug fix: when placing custom objects the post processing step sometimes accidentally removed vegetation around them; this has been fixed

-- Version 2.7.1, released 3-9-2019

 * Since it unfortunately transpires that Minecraft 1.14 no longer supports populating the map after generation, the Populate and Structures options will be disabled for the Minecraft 1.14 format
 * The "Caves everywhere" option now works
 * The Frost layer once again places snow on Deep Snow blocks

-- Version 2.7.0, released 18-8-2019

 * Implement support for Minecraft 1.14 (1.14.4 to be precise) and remove support for 1.13

-- Version 2.6.5, released 2-6-2019

 * Bug fix: make rotation of glass panes, etc. work again

-- Version 2.6.4, released 1-6-2019

 * Bug fix: correct the way materials with a "rotation" property were being mirrored. It was causing errors, or in the last release, mirroring to be disabled

-- Version 2.6.3, released 31-5-2019

 * Bug fix: don't try to mirror, rotate or invert materials for legacy platforms when there is no legacy equivalent of the transformed material

-- Version 2.6.2, released 30-5-2019

 * Bug fix: don't give errors about unselected plants in Custom Plant Layers when exporting to Minecraft 1.12
 * Bug fix: the Frost layer will once again turn water into ice
 * The beta Caves layer now honours the "breaks the surface" settings (but not yet the "remove water above openings" and "flood the caves" settings; that will come in the near future)
 * Fluids placed by the Resources layer will now flow in Minecraft 1.13 (this may cause Minecraft to be slow when first loading the chunks)

-- Version 2.6.1, released 27-5-2019

 * Bug fix: don't give errors about non-vanilla legacy blocks when exporting to Minecraft 1.12
 * Bug fix: make the endless border setting work again for Minecraft 1.12
 * Endless borders now also work for Minecraft 1.13
 * The "edit Superflat preset" button has been temporarily disabled as part of this fix; it will be implemented in the near future with a bespoke Superflat preset editing screen rather than a simple text field

-- Version 2.6.0, released 26-5-2019

 * Add support for Minecraft 1.13
   + You can now Export, Import and Merge maps directly to Minecraft 1.13 format
   + Because it is still in beta, it is not yet the default. You can select it from the 'Map format' drop-down on the Export or New World screens
   + For worlds in Minecraft 1.13 format, block type selection is now by name rather than by numerical ID
     - Similar to how you can select custom IDs for the Minecraft 1.2 to 1.12 format, for Minecraft 1.13 you can supply your own namespace, name and properties in order to use modded blocks
   + This support is still in beta, and has known and unknown bugs
     - Keep your own backups of your Minecraft maps and your .world files!
     - Please file issues on GitHub for any bugs you encounter: https://www.worldpainter.net/issues
     - When you file an issue, make sure to include all the details I need to reproduce the issue myself. Issues of type "it doesn't work" will be closed
 * Add new Caves layer
   + The new Caves layer creates worm-like tunnels that are more similar (although still different) to Minecraft's native caves than the Caverns and Chasms layers
   + This new layer is still in beta. The layout and appearance of the caves may change in later releases, so don't rely too much on the exact results of the current version just yet
 * Support tile entities (chests, etc.) from Structures (.nbt files)
 * Make support for .schem files more robust
 * Load the icons for the plants in the Custom Plants layer from the Minecraft 1.13 (or later) jar (and not older jars any more)
 * Bug fix: when duplicating a Custom Object layer, also duplicate the list of objects

-- Version 2.5.12, released 17-3-2019

 * Bug fix: don't ignore the water level when importing height maps

-- Version 2.5.11, released 9-3-2019

 * Add platform selection to height map import screen, allowing creation of worlds for platforms from plugins based on height maps
 * Bug fix: restore functionality of wpscript command

-- Version 2.5.10, released 22-2-2019

 * Never use bicubic interpolation when importing a height map at scale 100%, to prevent ringing artefacts in that case

-- Version 2.5.9, released 10-2-2019

 * Bug fix: allowing mapping from pure white colour (#ffffff) in scripts

-- Version 2.5.8, released 18-11-2018

 * Bug fix: the order of layered Custom Materials is no longer reversed
 * Bug fix: an error that occurred when creating Custom Materials of type Noise has been fixed

-- Version 2.5.7, released 5-9-2018

 * Bug fix: fix a major bug in the undo/redo mechanism, which would break when adding a ceiling or another dimension. It is now once again possible to switch between dimensions while keeping the full undo/redo history of each dimension

-- Version 2.5.6, released 28-7-2018

 * Work around an incompatibility with Minecraft 1.13 that caused Custom Object and Custom Layer previews to malfunction if it is installed. If you applied the workaround of configuring an advanced setting to point WorldPainter to a non-existent Minecraft installation, you can remove that workaround

-- Version 2.5.5, released 4-7-2018

 * Bug fix: when exporting worlds with a non-standard height, custom objects placed during the fix-up phase (along region borders) would be splattered all over the map. This will no longer happen

-- Version 2.5.4, released 22-6-2018

 * Addressed an unintended consequence of snow blocks now being considered insubstantial. It caused the Frost layer no longer to place Snow on Snow Blocks. Frost will now once again place Snow on Snow Blocks.

-- Version 2.5.3, released 18-6-2018

 * The thick smooth snow layer support introduced in the previous release now requires the data value to be 7 to be triggered, instead of data value 0. Create smooth deep snow layers by creating a Custom Ground Cover layer with the material set to "Snow (7)" (block ID 78 and data value 7)
 * Bug fix: remove development code that turned the terrain underneath smooth layers into red wool

-- Version 2.5.2, released 16-6-2018

 * An option has been added to the Merge operation for merging the underground portion of the world in addition to the overground
   + Previously the underground would always be copied unchanged from the existing map
   + By enabling this option WorldPainter will attempt to merge the underground portion as well, attempting to keep existing caves, resources and structures and adding new caves, resources and structures from your world. This allows you to, for instance, add manually created Cave/Tunnel layers to the map
   + If you don't want the resources, caves, etc. from the existing map to remain, use the already existing "Below ground" options for the existing map on the Merge screen to remove them
 * Added support for custom world types/generators. This enables you to, for example, easily create maps for the Biomes O' Plenty mod and other custom Minecraft world generators. To use, set the world type to Custom on the Export screen, and press the [...] button to set the generator name to store in the level.dat file, for example BIOMESOP for Biomes O' Plenty
 * It is now possible to create thick smooth snow layers by creating a Custom Ground Cover layer with the material set to "Snow (7)" (block ID 78 and data value 7)
   + It will place a mixture of Snow Blocks and Snow to create a layer that is as thick as you specify and smoothly follows the terrain, the variation setting of the layer, and the layer's edge shape
   + For nice smooth results, set the edge shape to Smooth and the width high, for example 10
   + For nice clean edges paint it with a solid brush at 100%, but experiment with rougher edges as well to see the effect
   + Note that it will not affect the biome, nor place snow on trees, etc.. To do that, paint Frost in the same location as well. If you want the Frost to overlap your deep snow layer exactly, use the Global Operations tool to paint it "only on" your deep snow layer
 * A rare behavioural change that may affect existing worlds: snow blocks (block ID 80) are now considered "insubstantial", meaning they will not block the placement of custom objects or other layers. This allows realistic deep snow layers that will not block the placement of trees, and will bury their lower trunks in a deep layer of snow. If you use snow blocks in your world in the same location as other layers, this change may affect the Export result
 * A "fit to dimension" button has been added to the image overlay settings on the Configure View screen (Ctrl+V or View menu) which will automatically set the scale and offset so that the image overlay exactly covers (as best as possible) the current dimension
 * A new advanced setting, org.pepsoft.worldpainter.smoothGroundCover, has been added which will add a "smooth" option to the Custom Ground Cover layer settings, allowing mod blocks that have snow-like variable height support to be exported with varying heights, just like smooth snow as exported by the Frost layer. See https://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/AdvancedSettings for details
 * A new advanced setting, org.pepsoft.worldpainter.insubstantialBlocks, had been added which allows you to mark mod blocks as "insubstantial", meaning that they will not block the placement of solid blocks. You can use this for example to mark leaf blocks from mods as insubstantial, so that they won't block the placement of modded trees and allow their canopies to overlap just like vanilla leaf blocks allow. See https://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/AdvancedSettings for details
 * Bug fix: resources placed by the Resources layer no longer bleed through steep slopes covered by the "keep steep terrain covered" setting
 * A few small bug fixes and improvements

-- Version 2.5.1, released 8-5-2018

 * Layered custom materials can now also be relative to the terrain when used as a Custom Terrain and when used as the underground material
   + The setting for this has been added to the Dimension Properties screen (and thus also the Export screen) in the form of the "Layered materials relative to" listboxes at the end of the first two lines on the General tab, which allow you to choose between Bedrock (the default, and old behaviour) and Terrain
   + There is only one setting for the entire surface; you cannot have some layered Custom Terrains be relative to the terrain and others relative to bedrock. If that's what you need then you can use Custom Ground Cover Layers with a negative thickness for the areas where you need the surface to be layered relative to the terrain (see release 2.5.0)
   + "Relative to terrain" means that the pattern will be rendered as the topmost part of the terrain, following the shape of the terrain. The topmost layer of the pattern will be the surface block; the next layer one block down, etc.
   + This does not affect the top layer minimum and maximum depth settings. If the pattern is higher than the top layer thickness then the lower part will not be used; if it is smaller then either the pattern will be repeated (if "repeat" is set) or the lowermost block will be repeated down
   + For the underground material the meaning is exactly the same. The pattern will be rendered relative to the terrain, but since the underground material does not actually extend all the way up to the terrain, the top part of the pattern will be replaced with the surface terrain type
 * Autosaves will not be performed while exporting or merging, or while already in a save dialog. In addition, the autosave popup will no longer steal the keyboard focus
 * Having multiple simultaneous instances of WorldPainter running is once again allowed, but for all but the first instance autosave will be disabled! You will be warned of this by a popup at the startup of additional instances
 * Bug fix: fix the behaviour of the "solo" checkboxes which are supposed to show only that layer and hide all others, but which were malfunctioning when the mouse hovered over any of the other "solo" checkboxes
 * Bug fix: the support library which caused problems on Java 10 on Mac OS X and Linux has been fixed, so the workaround which locked the visual theme has been removed
 * Bug fix: fill in the outside edges of an imported map with Minecraft biomes correctly, instead of displaying those missing chunks as Void

-- Version 2.5.0, released 23-4-2018

 * It is now possible to duplicate existing Custom Layers by right-clicking on their button and selecting "Duplicate...". This will open a copy of the layer in question with the same settings as the original, which you can then modify and save as a new layer. Make sure to give it a different name and colour to avoid confusion
 * Layered custom materials can now be relative to the terrain, or to the top of the ground cover, when used in Custom Ground Cover Layers. A new "layers relative to" setting has been added to the Edit Layer Settings screen which is only active for layered materials and has the following choices:
   + Bedrock - this is the old behaviour where the layers start at height 0
   + Terrain - the bottom most layer of the layered material will be placed on top of the terrain - this is the new default for Custom Ground Cover Layers
   + Top of ground cover - the top most layer of the layered material will be placed at the top of the ground cover. If the Custom Ground Cover Layer has sloping edges then the layered material will slope down with it
 * Only one instance of WorldPainter can now be running at a time. If you try to start a second instance, the first one will be brought to the foreground instead. This is to prevent problems with the new autosave mechanism

-- Version 2.4.8, released 21-4-2018

 * An autosave mechanism has been implemented:
   + WorldPainter will autosave the world every five minutes (if it has changed, and after ten seconds of inactivity)
   + If WorldPainter is not shut down correctly, it will load the autosaved world automatically the next time it is started
   + You can disable the autosave mechanism on the Preferences screen if you wish. You can also configure the guard time (the time you have to be inactive before it will autosave) and interval (the minimum time between autosaves) there
   + The autosave is stored separately from your .world file, in the WorldPainter config directory
   + WorldPainter keeps a copy of the previous three autosaves in the same directory, which you could manually recover if your autosaved changes somehow get lost or overwritten

-- Version 2.4.7, released 18-4-2018

 * Administrative update: replace expired keys and certificates

-- Version 2.4.6, released 18-4-2018

 * Bug fix: don't normalise the thicknesses of the layers of a layered material to add up to 1000

-- Version 2.4.5, released 17-4-2018

 * On Mac OS X with Java 10, lock the visual theme to Metal to work around a bug in a support library. To use other visual themes, downgrade Java to version 8, or wait for a new release of WorldPainter with the fixed support library (it is not yet known when this will be released)
 * Bug fix: fix a recurring error message while Exporting a world on Mac OS X
 * Bug fix: fix a problem with the scrollbar range being too small when zoomed out, making it difficult to scroll to the entire extent of the world

-- Version 2.4.4, released 13-4-2018

 * The usability of the Complex Custom Material editor has been improved. Instead of continually adjusting the occurrences so that they add up to 1000‰, which made it extremely difficult to set them to exact values, that redistribution is now done when saving the material, in such a way that their proportions stay the same (so it will not affect the result)
 * WorldPainter can now be started in safe mode. In this mode it will not load plugins or custom brushes; not change the visual theme; not load the background image; etc.. This may allow it to start successfully if a problem with one of these is causing normal startup to fail. Functionality may be limited; this mode is not intended for doing work, but for diagnosing problems and changing preferences. To start WorldPainter in safe mode, use the new "WorldPainter (Safe Mode)" start menu entry, or on the command line add the parameter "--safe"
 * An advanced setting has been added to specify the Minecraft installation directory, if you have it installed in a non-standard location. See https://www.worldpainter.net/doc/advancedSettings for details
 * For unknown reasons, initialising the Minecraft runtime in order to be able to load .nbt files sometimes failed, causing an error when trying to add custom objects to a Custom Object Layer. This failure should now happen silently so that you can continue normally (but without .nbt support)
 * A workaround has been implemented for a bug in the JIDE docking framework that prevented WorldPainter from starting on Mac OS X with Java 10 installed

-- Version 2.4.3, released 5-2-2018

 * Bug fix: make loading schematics work again

-- Version 2.4.2, released 1-2-2018

 * Added support for new blocks in Minecraft 1.11 and 1.12
 * Added support for the Minecraft 1.12.2 jar for displaying Minecraft biomes
 * The Export and Merge buttons on their respective screens are no longer disabled if some condition is not met. This was causing confusion. Instead, an error message will be displayed when you press Export or Merge, explaining the problem
 * Entities from custom objects will now be assigned a random UUID each time they are placed by WorldPainter, making it once again possible to use (for instance) schematics to place mobs and other entities in the map. Previously Minecraft would remove all but one of such entities, since they all shared the same UUID
 * Bug fix: fix some incompatibilities with Java 9

-- Version 2.4.1, released 5-2-2017

 * Bug fix: make Importing existing Minecraft maps work again

-- Version 2.4.0, released 4-2-2017

 * There are two new selection modification operations on the Global Operations tool screen: "add to selection" and "remove from selection" which together with the filter settings allows you to sculpt complex and intricate selections based on the contents of the world
 * It is now possible to hide the terrain type and the fluids (water and lava), or show *just* the terrain, hiding all layers. This is done with the new checkboxes on the Terrain panel. Deselecting "Show Terrain" will turn the surface entirely grey, hiding the terrain type and making layers easier to see. Selecting "Solo Terrain" will hide all layers. And deselecting "Show Water/Lava" will remove all water and lava from view, making it easier to see river, lake and ocean beds. Just as with the other "show" checkboxes: whenever the corresponding tool or paint is selected the layer *will* be shown, regardless of the checkbox setting. In other words: when you have the Flood or Lava tools selected the fluids will always be shown, and whenever you have any terrain type selected the terrain will always be shown
 * The four terrain shaping operations (Height, Flatten, Smooth and Raise Mountain) now have an option on the Tool Settings panel: "Apply theme". When enabled (which is the default only for Raise Mountain), applying the operation will also reset the terrain type to the theme (the default terrain settings), as well as apply or remove any layers contained in the theme (such as the Frost layer by default)
   + Applying the theme now will also remove layers, where it would previously only add them. This only applies to the layers actually contained in the theme (by default this is only the Frost layer). Applying the theme happens when the new "Apply theme" tool setting is active, or the "reset terrain and layers to theme" operation on the Global Operations screen is used, or when right-clicking with a painting tool selected and a terrain type as the active paint
 * Export and Merge operations are now done with low priority threads, reducing the impact on the responsiveness of the rest of the system
   PLEASE NOTE: this does mean that if you start other resource intensive programs while WorldPainter is Exporting or Merging, those programs will take precedence and delay the Export or Merge operation
 * Directional lighting can now be turned off. This has been implemented by adding a fifth direction: "from above", which you can select by pressing "rotate left" once when the light direction is "north west" (the default), or "rotate right" when the direction is "south west"
 * High resolution display support on Windows. WorldPainter now should use the full resolution of your high resolution (more than 120 dpi) display instead of scaling everything up two times on Windows. It's not perfect yet, so please let us know of any visual problems on high resolution displays. Note that as a result, visual themes are unfortunately no longer supported for high resolution displays on Windows

-- Version 2.3.6, released 5-1-2017

 * Bug fix: make working with Combined Layers work again without crashing WorldPainter
 * Bug fix: since version 2.3.0, when editing multiple Custom Objects at once, WorldPainter has been resetting the offsets to zero. This has now been fixed

-- Version 2.3.5, released 4-1-2017

 * Should be more robust at loading combined layers that had previously been affected by a custom terrain related bug. Such layers, and worlds containing them, should now load without crashing WorldPainter, but the custom terrains from them might be lost. WorldPainter will inform you if that happens
 * Bug fix: correctly interpret the layer intensities for Custom Underground Pockets layers
   PLEASE NOTE: check your maps in which you use Custom Underground Pockets layers! They have been incorrectly mapping layer intensity to block frequency. The intention, and how they now work, is: at 50% intensity the blocks are as frequent as you specified in the layer settings; at 1% intensity they are half as frequent and at 100% they are twice as frequent. If you set the frequency to 1000‰ it will be completely solid anywhere it is painted at 50% intensity (the default) or higher

-- Version 2.3.4, released 26-12-2016

 * Bug fix: make Merge work once again, by fixing a bug in the directory moving logic.
   PLEASE NOTE: if you have tried to Merge maps with version 2.3.3 and run into this error you will first have to restore that map from the backup made by WorldPainter before you can Merge with it again! If the map is in <minecraft dir>\saves\<MapName> then the backup will be in <minecraft dir>\backups\<MapName>.<timestamp>. You can just copy all files and directories from the backup directory over those in the map directory

-- Version 2.3.3, released 23-12-2016

 * The Brush Settings panel now has "in selection" and "outside selection" options to apply operations only inside or outside the selection. This also applies to the Global Operations tool
 * Bug fix: don't crash when trying to Export or Merge on Windows versions older than Windows 7
 * Bug fix: don't allow the Copy Selection tool to be selected when there is no selection

-- Version 2.3.2, released 9-12-2016

 * Custom materials have a persistent identity which was causing confusion when exporting custom terrains and then importing them into the same world, which would result in them both being linked to the same material. To lessen confusion, custom terrain materials are now always duplicated when explicitly loading a custom terrain type from a file
 * Bug fix: fix an error that occurred when loading a world containing combined layers containing custom terrains

-- Version 2.3.1, released 4-12-2016

 * Bug fix: fix an error that occurred when background tile painting was overwhelmed by rapid changes, such as when changing values by holding down buttons
 * Bug fix: don't place superfluous columns of falling water or lava on the edges of the Void layer

-- Version 2.3.0, released 27-11-2016

 * Selection and duplication tools have been added:
   + The new Edit Selection tool allows you to add the brush shape to the selection (by left clicking) or remove it from the selection (by right clicking)
   + The new Copy Selection tool will copy the selection to a target location. The brush shape will change to the bounding rectangle of the selected area so you can accurately judge where it will be copied
     - There is NO CLIPBOARD! The copy is a live copy of what is currently in the selected area. Note that the target area of a copy may overlap the selected area and WorldPainter will do the right thing, but a subsequent copy will also include the changes to the area under selection
     - There is a new Tool Settings panel, which will show options for the Copy Selection tool when it is selected, allowing you to configure various options:
       o Exactly which aspects of the selected area to copy (terrain height, type, layers, etc.)
       o Whether new tiles should be created if the target area of the copy extends outside the existing tiles (*please note* that this cannot be undone!)
       o Whether the edges of the selected area should be smoothly blended into the surroundings, over a distance of sixteen blocks (two chunks) on the inside of the selection edge. *Please note* that this will make the copy operation _much_ slower!
       o This panel may show options for other tools in the future
   + The new Clear Selection button will instantly remove the selected area
   + Note that all selection, copy and deselection operations can be undone like any other operation, except if new tiles had to be created for a copy operation
 * The way Custom Terrains are configured has changed: instead of displaying buttons for all of them, buttons are created only when you configure a new Custom Terrain, similar to how custom layers work. To configure a new Custom Terrain, click on the + button on the Terrain or Custom Terrain panels. The Custom Terrain panel is now only displayed once at least one Custom Terrain is configured, again similar to custom layers
 * In addition, the maximum number of Custom Terrains that can be created has been doubled, from 48 to 96
 * More view options have been added to the Configure View screen (Ctrl+V or View -> Configure view...):
   + The painting of the Minecraft biomes surrounding the world can be turned off
   + The painting of the border can be turned off
   + You can now set a background image with various repeat and stretch options, which will be shown in the background of the editor wherever it is not obscured by tiles, biomes or border, and wherever the Void layer is painted
   + The background colour (visible wherever not obscured by tiles, biomes, border and/or background image) can be changed
 * When trying to Export a world using the Populate layer, or the "allow Minecraft to populate the entire terrain" option, and the Superflat world type (including endless borders), display a warning that Minecraft won't populate chunks for Superflat worlds
 * Custom objects which would extend below the bottom, or above the top of the map, are no longer exported
 * The progress and error state of Export and Merge operations is now displayed on the WorldPainter icon on the task bar for Windows 7 and later
 * In addition, there is now a Minimize button on the Export and Merge progress screens so you can stow the program away while it is working
 * Bug fix: fix an error in the logic for supporting sand with sandstone which would result in the wrong kind of sandstone, and occasionally cause errors
 * Bug fix: custom objects from Custom Object Layers added as floor layers to a Custom Caves/Tunnels Layer were not being placed on the solid floor of tunnels; this has been fixed
 * Bug fix: the slope angles of repeating layered custom materials are no longer inverted every time the material is edited

-- Version 2.2.6, released 25-10-2016

 * Bug fix: the scaling of height maps was reversed; this has now been fixed
 * Some other fixes and improvements have been applied to the height map import process

-- Version 2.2.5, released 23-10-2016

 * A new Info panel has been added, which displays more details about the block beneath the cursor than are already displayed on the status bar. Among other things, it shows a list of all the layers present on that block, and their intensities. It also shows the high resolution (16-bit) block height. It is behind the existing Brush Settings panel in the lower right corner of the window by default
 * A function has been added for deleting layers which are not in use. It is located in the Edit menu as "Delete unused layers...". By default it selects all unused layers, but you can deselect any layers you want to keep before deletion. Note that if you unpaint all traces of a layer from the dimension manually it does not count as unused until you save and load the world, or you use the Global Operations tool to remove the layer (which is easier and more efficient than manually unpainting it)
 * It is no longer possible to manually provide Minecraft jars when WorldPainter needs one, for example to calculate biomes for the Biomes Viewer. WorldPainter needs an installed copy of Minecraft, of a supported version and in the default location, in order to be able to display biomes or load saved structures
 * The long terrain and biomes selection menus in the brush filter settings have been broken up into multiple submenus with no more than 25 entries each, to make sure they fit on small screens
 * Bug fix: post processing to apply Minecraft block placement rules is now also applied to fixups (e.g. objects placed around region borders, after the regions involved have been generated)
 * Bug fix: 16-bit (high resolution) height maps are now properly scaled, instead of being downgraded to 8 bits whenever they were imported at a scale other than 100%. The height maps process is now also more efficient, especially for large height maps

-- Version 2.2.4, released 20-8-2016

 * Bug fix: fix a bug which prevented WorldPainter from starting with the Autumn Forest plugin installed. WorldPainter will now start again, but note that that plugin is very old and does not work anymore with the current version of WorldPainter, so it is better to remove it

-- Version 2.2.3, released 7-8-2016

 * Update the Minecraft version number in the "map format" combobox on the Export screen to 1.10
 * Bug fix: make limiting the brush to a specific annotation colour work again

-- Version 2.2.2, released 6-8-2016

 * Disable the Structures option on the Export screen for endless borders, to prevent structures from being generated in the borders
 * Bug fix: make importing Minecraft maps work again

-- Version 2.2.1, released 6-8-2016

 * Added preliminary support for using structures saved from Minecraft using structure blocks as custom objects in Custom Object Layers. Note that entities and tile entities are not yet fully supported
 * In addition to fixed size borders you can now also set the border size to "endless" for worlds surrounded by endless water, lava or void. When you do so, WorldPainter will set the world type to Superflat, with the appropriate preset to generate the right border chunks. Because of this you will not be able to select a different world type when the border size is set to "endless". Circular worlds will now have their border set to endless void by default
 * Added preliminary support for the new 1.10 block types
 * The progress of Exports and Merges is reported in more detail, with separate progress bars per parallel operation and per task, so you can better see exactly what WorldPainter is doing and which part might be taking long
 * The number of grid lines is automatically reduced when zooming out so that they are not too close together and obscure the view. They will not be painted closer together than 32 pixels, or the grid size at 100% zoom, whichever is smaller
 * Support the Minecraft 1.10.2 jar for calculating the Minecraft biomes
 * Scripting: filters can now apply to a single layer value, or any value lower than or higher than a specific value, by adding .withValue(value), .withValue(value).orLower() or .withValue(value).orHigher() after the onlyOnLayer(layer) or exceptOnLayer(layer)
 * Bug fix: fix a bug which would cause the layer thicknesses of layered custom materials to change, every time you tried to edit them
 * Bug fix: make previews of combined layers work
 * Bug fix: fix an error which occurred when trying to import a height map into an old world

-- Version 2.2.0, released 18-3-2016

 * Added support for the new 1.9 block types
   + New terrain type: Grass Path
   + New plant types for Custom Plant layers: Chorus Flower, Beetroots and Nether Wart
 * Height maps can now be imported into existing worlds, and into other dimensions than the surface
   + Select Edit -> Import -> Height map into current dimension... to do so
   + You can adjust the scale and offset to import the height map into the desired location in your existing world
   + The "create new tiles" option, selected by default, causes WorldPainter to create new tiles automatically for the new land, if necessary
 * Image masks can now be imported to set the terrain type, or any layer of your choosing
   + Select Edit -> Import -> Mask as terrain or layer... to do so
   + Select an image, then select the target to apply it to (the terrain or a layer), then select the mapping (the method with which the image values should be translated to terrain or layer values)
   + WorldPainter will automatically let you select only targets and mappings which make sense for the image type and the selected target
   + For most layers, and for setting the terrain, you need a (real) grey scale (8 or 16 bit) or black and white (1 bit) image. A colour/RGB image which happens to contain only shades of grey is NOT a grey scale image and won't work!
   + The available mappings are:
     - One to one - this sets the layer value to the exact value from the image and can be used for the terrain, for discrete layers such as Biomes, and for continuous layers, allowing you to create masks which will directly set terrain or layer values
       o Targets for which the image contains values which are too high will not be selectable
       o For setting the terrain, the value should be an index from this page: http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/Scripting/TerrainTypeValues
       o For the Biomes layer, the value should be a Minecraft biome ID from this page: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome#Biome_IDs, or 255 for Automatic Biomes
       o Continuous layers support values from 0 (0%) to 15 (100%)
     - Full range - this maps the full range of the grey scale values (0 to 255 for 8 bit, 0 to 65535 for 16 bit) to the full range of the selected layer (0% to 100%)
     - Threshold - this sets on/off layers (such as Frost, Cave/Tunnel layers, Custom Ground Cover layers, etc.) only in those places where the image value is equal to or higher than the threshold you select
     - Dither - this uses the full grey scale range (0 to 255 for 8 bit, 0 to 65535 for 16 bit) to dither on/off layers
   + The Annotations layer supports importing colour images with an alpha mask
     - Where the image is transparent the annotation will not be set
     - Otherwise the annotation will be set to the closest colour
     - No dithering is applied
 * Support the Minecraft 1.9 jar for calculating the Minecraft biomes
 * Worlds can now be exported as a high res (16-bit) height map. Choose File -> Export -> Export as high resolution height map... to do so. This allows you to scale it outside of WorldPainter and create a new world from the scaled height map without losing WorldPainter's high internal precision which allows smooth editing, Smooth Snow to work, etc.. Note that this is not available if the world is higher than 256 blocks
 * Bug fix: correct the default ordering of Custom Ground Cover layers so that thicker layers once again export before thinner layers
 * Bug fix: make exporting the 3D view as an image work again on Mac OS X

-- Version 2.1.6, released 7-2-2016

 * Bug fix: make Export work again. Sorry about that!

-- Version 2.1.5, released 7-2-2016

 * It is now possible to change the order in which Custom Layers are exported, as well as to temporarily disable a layer so that it is not exported. You can do this on the new "Custom Layers" tab on the Export screen
 * A new property has been added to Custom Objects: "extend foundation". When set, any solid blocks on the lowest layer of a Custom Object will be extended downwards towards the ground (or the first solid block) if it ends up floating in the air. This way you can give objects "legs", "roots" or "foundations" which will automatically be extended by WorldPainter to sit on the ground. The new setting is on the individual object settings screen, and by default it is turned off. You can change it for a number of objects at once by selecting multiple objects and pressing the Edit button next to the list
 * The status bar now shows the slope of the land beneath the cursor in degrees, next to the height
 * Slight startup optimisation (no longer hangs while scanning for Minecraft jars)
 * Bug fix: the code signing certificate used for version 2.1.4 had expired, causing warnings and errors. From version 2.1.5 the digital signature is once again valid
 * Bug fix: plant layers no longer obliterate what is already there
 * Bug fix: newly created worlds abide by the default "cover steep terrain" setting set in the Preferences
 * Bug fix: the Custom Plants layer will now place dead shrubs on sand and hardened clay
 * Bug fix: an error would occur when trying to run a script in WorldPainter which did not have a descriptor comment block at the start. This has been fixed; a descriptor is no longer required for simple scripts without parameters

-- Version 2.1.4, released 17-1-2016

 * 24 additional custom terrain slots have been added, for a total of 48 possible custom terrain types
 * Scripts can now be executed inside WorldPainter, from the Tools menu -> Run script...
   + A popup will be shown which allows the user to enter command line arguments for the script, and which will display the output from the script
   + Scripts can output text by calling the print() function (this is not different than when running them with wpscript)
   + The currently loaded world is available to the script as the global variable "world", and the currently visible dimension as "dimension"
   + Scripts can make changes to the world or dimension (and even to other dimensions not currently displayed)
   + Changes made by the script can be undone like any manual operation
   + The last used script is remembered, as is the list of previously used scripts, for quick access
   + Scripts have full access to the world data, so this is a potentially extremely powerful technique
 * Remember previously used directories better by working around a bug in Java on Windows
 * Change the language of the donation page to English
 * Bug fix: allow complete removal of layer with rotated brush, instead of leaving 1% behind
 * Bug fix: allow selection of Roofed Forest M (157) biome

-- Version 2.1.3, released 29-11-2015

 * Annotations have been added to the brush filter "only on" and "except on" settings, in a separate submenu. You can either chose any annotations, or a particular colour. PLEASE NOTE: Annotations are displayed on top of everything else, which will make it seem as though nothing is happening when you paint "only on" an annotation. Hide the annotations using the "show" checkbox on the Annotations panel to see the effects
 * The Merge world dialog has been slightly rearranged and reworked to make it clearer that "merge biomes only" always merges the entire Surface dimension and disregards any tile selection
 * Bug fix: the intensity sliders for the "... layer everywhere" settings in the Dimension Properties no longer slowly wander to the right. PLEASE NOTE: check the settings in your worlds if you use those options!
 * Bug fix: fix wpscript to make loading worlds from before version 2.0 work again

-- Version 2.1.2, released 24-11-2015

 * It is now possible to Import and Merge the Nether and End dimensions!
   + The Import Minecraft Map screen now has checkboxes, checked by default but only enabled for the dimensions the selected map actually has, indicating whether you want to import the Nether and/or End dimensions. You must always import the Surface dimension
   + Similarly the Merge screen now has checkboxes indicating which dimensions you want to Merge, also enabled only for the dimensions actually present. Here you are allowed to skip merging the Surface dimension
   + Any dimensions you chose not to Merge are copied unchanged from the existing map
   + WorldPainter remembers which dimension(s) you chose to Merge the previous time, in the .world file
   + If you make a tile selection on the Merge screen you can only merge that dimension

-- Version 2.1.1, released 23-11-2015

 * WorldPainter now remembers the ten most recently used worlds; you can open them from File -> Recently used Worlds
 * The Minecraft world border is now displayed in the editor as a red dashed line. By default the border is very far away (thirty million blocks in each direction) and you will never see it, but you can adjust it on the Dimension Properties screen
 * The image on the button of the currently selected brush is now rotated according to the current brush rotation

-- Version 2.1.0, released 22-11-2015

 * The menu items have been slightly renamed and rearranged. File -> Import is now called "Import new World" to make it clearer that you are creating a new World instead of importing something into the current World. Importing Layers has been moved to Edit -> Import
 * It is now possible to import multiple custom items (layers, terrains and biomes) at once from an existing .world file! Select Edit -> Import -> "Custom items from existing world", select an existing .world file, select the Custom Layers, Custom Terrains and/or Custom Biomes you wish to import from it and hit OK
 * It is now possible to import multiple custom terrains at once from the Edit -> Import -> "Custom Terrain(s) from File(s)..." menu item. They are automatically assigned to the first available free custom terrain slots. If you select more custom terrain files than there are free slots an error will be given
 * The Minecraft world border can now be configured from the Dimension Properties and Export screens, next to where the WorldPainter border is configured. A future update will also show the Minecraft border in the editor
 * The Read Only layer is now always enabled, even for non-imported worlds. This makes it easier to Export a map and then repeatedly Merge changes and additions from the same .world file to the generated map. You can use the Read Only layer in that workflow to mark the areas which have not changed and should not be merged, protecting existing structures and speeding up the Merge
 * When you select Merge for a world created in WorldPainter (instead of imported from Minecraft), the warning that it is not an imported world is now only shown the first time. Once you have Merged it once you are no longer bothered with that warning
 * WorldPainter now remembers with which map a world was last Merged and preselects that map when you select Merge again
 * Bug fix: make the wpscript command work again
 * Bug fix: don't export floating Resources in Void borders

-- Version 2.0.2, released 27-9-2015

 * In addition to default terrain types by altitude you can now also configure default layers by altitude. This applies when creating worlds from scratch from the New World screen (there is a new "advanced" surface type setting) or when creating worlds from height maps, and you can edit the default layers afterwards from the Dimension Properties screen (Ctrl+P). This support always existed (this is how a Frost layer was placed on high altitudes), but now there is a user interface for configuring it
 * The Select Custom Material screen now has a Simple mode, which is the default, to be easier for new users and for when you want a simple material consisting of just one block type. Click on the Complex tab for the multi-material modes
 * Added an option for resetting all workspace layouts, including those of all saved worlds, and moved workspace layout menu items to submenu
 * Make sure that resetting the configuration by deleting the config file also resets the acceleration type setting
 * Show a message and undo the operation if a flood fill fails due to the area being too large, instead of crashing with an error
 * There have been reports of worlds which use unconfigured custom terrains, causing missing tiles in the editor and errors during export. It's not yet known how this can happen, but a workaround has been implemented so that these unconfigured custom terrains are now displayed with a magenta colour (so it's easy to see where they are used) and a clearer error message is displayed on export
 * Bug fix: make removing Combined Layers work again

-- Version 2.0.1, released 18-9-2015

 * Bug fix: make "reset terrain type to default" operation on Global Operations screen work again
 * Bug fix: make brush filters work correctly again, instead of reflecting tile 0,0 any time the painted area was completely contained in one tile
 * Bug fix: don't crash with NullPointerExceptions while adding custom objects. The cause of the bug is not yet known, but a workaround has been implemented so that the problem is silently logged. It is possible that as a result the 3D preview will remain empty or incomplete. Please let the author know if that happens!
 * Bug fix: don't try to flood fill or let the user enter text if she has not selected a paint yet (which was causing error messages)
 * Bug fix: fix some problems that caused errors when selecting or first using brushes in some circumstances
 * Bug fix: don't cause an additional exception when handling an exception with an empty stack trace

-- Version 2.0.0, released 13-9-2015

 * WorldPainter now requires Java 8! Download Java 8 from Oracle here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
 * The 32-bit version no longer works on 64-bit Windows. If you have 64-bit Windows, make sure to have 64-bit Java installed and to download the 64-bit version of WorldPainter. You can download 64-bit Java here by choosing "Windows x64" (the .exe variant): http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
 * The way of painting layers, terrain and biomes has been changed. You now have a set of powerful new general painting tools, which can paint with any terrain, layer or biome you select
   + This means that instead of just selecting a layer or terrain in order to paint it, you must now select the "paint" (a layer, a terrain, a biome or an annotation colour) from one of the palettes *and* a painting tool from the top row of the tool box. For the old behaviour, select the Spray Paint tool (the top left button in the tool box, or Alt+r)
   + The new painting tools are powerful and flexible. They are:
     - The Spray Paint tool. This tool works exactly like the old way of painting layers, terrain and biomes. It applies the selected "paint" to the world in the shape of the current brush continuously as long as you hold down the mouse button
       o On/off layers (like Frost) and discrete layers (like Biomes and Annotations) are dithered
     - The Pencil. This is a line drawing tool which paints continuous lines of the selected "paint" by applying the current brush along a line
       o Paint freehand lines by clicking and dragging the mouse
       o Paint dots by clicking and releasing the mouse
       o Draw straight lines from the previously painted dot or line-end, by holding Shift while clicking the mouse
       o Constrain the lines to 45 degree angles by holding Ctrl while clicking. This works for freehand line drawing (Ctrl + drag) as well as for straight lines (Ctrl + Shift + click)
       o On/off layers (like Frost) and discrete layers (like Biomes and Annotations) are NOT dithered; they are applied where the brush intensity is 75% or higher
     - The Fill tool. This tool will fill whole areas of the world with the selected "paint"
       o For layers the area that is filled is bounded by the area where the selected layer already exists at the same or higher intensity. The area is filled to the currently selected intensity. In other words you first paint the edges of the area you want to fill using the other tools, leaving no gaps, and then fill in the area
       o For terrain types the area that is filled is the contiguous area with the same terrain type as where you clicked. In other words the terrain type you click on is replaced with the selected terrain type
       o Biomes and annotations work the same as terrain types; the contiguous area with the same biome or annotation colour where you clicked is replaced
     - The Text tool. This allows you to draw text on the world with any font, size and orientation. It's primarily an annotation tool which makes the most sense to use with the colours on the Annotations panel, but it works with any selected layer, terrain or biome as well, if you wish
       o The text can be rotated in 90 degree steps
   + All these tools (including Fill and Text) support performing the inverse operation by right-clicking instead of left-clicking. Layers are removed, biomes are reset to automatic and terrain is reset according to the Default Terrain settings of the Dimension Properties
   + The workspace layout will be reset once (the default as well as those for specific world files)
   + Callouts will appear upon starting the program, drawing your attention to the fact that you must now select a tool first. They will disappear as you make the selection(s), and will only be shown the first three times you run the program
 * All custom layer settings screens, and object settings screens, now have previews provided by dynmap (except the layers which already had a more useful preview)
   + The layer settings screens show what one tile would look like in-game with the layer applied using the current settings, providing a way to evaluate those settings. A drop down list provides a few different patterns for the layer to be distributed in the preview.
   + The view can be rotated and zoomed using the buttons on the screen and the mouse wheel, and panned using the mouse
 * The Custom Object Layer has received some improvements:
   + It now supports bo3 objects! The support is basic; advanced features such as branches and block checks are *not* supported. However, random blocks *are* supported, as are tile entities (chests, etc.)!
   + It now has a sparseness setting with which you can control the overall density of the layer. The setting controls per how many blocks the layer will attempt to place an object (the actual number of placed objects may be fewer if objects cannot be placed, for instance due to inappropriate underground or intersecting another object). The configured value corresponds to a layer intensity of 50% (the default). The effective values at 1% and 100% intensity are also displayed
 * The Custom Caves/Tunnels Layer can now place other layers on the tunnel floors!
   + The layer settings screen has a new Floor Layers tab, on which you can add and configure layers, either existing ones or new ones
   + These layers will be rendered on the floor of any caves/tunnels created by the Caves/Tunnels Layer
   + You have limited control over where and how intensely these layers are applied: you can set a base intensity as a percentage, and you can specify a random variation which is added to the base intensity. In addition you can specify a minimum and maximum height at which the layer should be applied
 * The map can now be shifted horizontally!
   + The map can only be shifted by whole tiles (in other words in steps of 128 blocks)
   + The new operation can be found next to the Rotate operation in the toolbar and looks like a cross with four arrows. It is also in the Edit menu, underneath the existing Rotate item
   + It affects the currently showing dimension, and by default also the corresponding ceiling or surface dimension, although that can be turned off
   + The Rotate operation used to affect all dimensions, but that has been changed to be consistent with the new Shift operation
   + Rotate and Shift operations destroy all undo and redo information and therefore they cannot be undone!
 * If you use half slabs as a custom terrain type, WorldPainter will automatically combine it with double slabs of the same type to make smoother terrain
   + This is great for creating, for instance, smooth cobblestone or stone slab roads (easily made with the new Pencil tool) which you can walk without having to jump
   + The requirements are the same as for Smooth Snow: the world must either be hand crafted, or created from a high resolution (16-bit) height map. Worlds created from 8-bit height maps won't have the extra precision needed, although you can create it by using the Smooth tool along the path of the area where you want to apply this feature
 * The tile selection screen and the biomes viewer now show the grid, to make selection of specific tiles or regions easier
 * The tile selection screen in addition now shows the border and/or bedrock wall, to better judge how the tiles fit into the surrounding Minecraft-generated land
 * There are now two new performance settings on a new Performance tab of the Preferences screen
   + The first setting controls the hardware acceleration scheme used for painting the editor. Experiment with it to determine which scheme performs best on your computer. Note that you need to restart WorldPainter for the change to take effect
   + The second setting concerns the way the overlay image is scaled and painted. There are different ways and which one performs best depends on many factors, such as the size and type of the image, how much regular and video RAM you have, your video driver and Java version, etc., etc. If you have problems with the overlay image, try experimenting with this setting
   + Note that *both* these settings are provided on a best effort basis! Since Java is a cross platform framework which isolates the code from the hardware it is impossible to exert tight control over these things. WorldPainter *tries* to guide and hint the Java runtime to use the configured settings, but there is no guarantee that they will take effect, or that it will make a difference. The only way to find out what works is to try them all
   + Note that the Undo setting has also been moved to this new tab
 * WorldPainter now keeps a log of major actions performed on a world, which you can review by selecting "View world history..." from the View menu. It logs things such as when the world was created or imported, exported or merged, expanded or contracted, etc.
 * The merge process now preserves non-standard content from the existing level.dat file, such as for instance block ID mappings stored there by mods.
 * When importing existing Minecraft maps the chunks that have to be added around the edges to make up whole tiles are handled a little more elegantly: instead of being marked "read only" they are marked "not present" and are not displayed in the editor and are not Exported or Merged. The "Not Present" layer is a normal layer like the "Read Only" layer which you can remove in the normal way if you want the chunk to be present
 * When importing existing Minecraft maps biomes which match what WorldPainter's automatic biome would be are imported as automatic (so that they automatically change appropriately when editing the world)
 * The brush images on the brush buttons are no longer rotated when the brush rotation is changed, since it took too much time with many custom brushes. Instead the brush outline will show an arrow indicating the original top of the brush
 * Added support for the Minecraft 1.8.8 jar file for calculating biomes
 * Bug fix: don't change floating red sand to chiseled sandstone
 * Bug fix: use correct data value for goodies chest so that it shows again in-game

-- Version 1.11.2, released 28-6-2015

 * Bug fix: make the File -> Open World screen work again on Macs

-- Version 1.11.1, released 26-4-2015

 * You can now choose Lava for the "except on" or "only on" option in the brush filter settings
 * The Merge process now leaves the "inhabited time" of each chunk intact so that regional difficulty is not affected
 * Slightly better Mac integration, still a work in progress
 * Bug fix: you can once again create new layered custom materials without getting an error message

-- Version 1.11.0, released 25-4-2015

 * Maps can now have ceilings! The ceilings are separate dimensions which you can customise as desired and which will be rendered upside down over the surface, allowing you to create covered/dark/cavernous maps with full control over the floor (and the ceiling)
   + Add a ceiling with the Edit -> Add Ceiling to Surface..., Add Ceiling to Nether... and Add Ceiling to End... options
   + Once added, the corresponding "Remove ..." menu items become active, allowing you to remove them again. Removing the Nether or End will also remove its ceiling, if any; you can't have a ceiling without a surface
   + You can quickly switch to and from the ceiling of the current dimension by pressing Ctrl+C or ⌘+C
   + Wherever the ceiling intersects the surface a black crosshatch pattern will be drawn to make it clear where the two dimensions meet and the map will be solid. Wherever the two intersect the solid blocks from the surface dimension will take precedence
   + You can use any kind of layer, above or below the surface, on the ceiling that you want. They will be rendered upside down. Of course many Minecraft blocks such as plants, snow, etc. require a block beneath them; those will not be exported (Minecraft would remove them anyway). Unsupported sand will have the lowest block changed to sandstone so that it doesn't fall down
   + You can lower the entire ceiling for a lower total map height (but less space, obviously). To do so, switch to the ceiling dimension from the View menu, open the Dimension Properties (Ctrl+P, toolbar button or Edit menu) and adjust the "Ceiling height" setting downwards
   + Minecraft will spawn you on top of the world instead of inside it (even though WorldPainter sets the spawn point inside). You'll want to use creative mode so you can dig down to the surface through the bedrock that caps the map, or enable the "bottomless world" option for the ceiling dimension so that there is no bedrock
   + You can use this to create an upside down map: fill the surface completely with Void, add a ceiling and paint your terrain, layers, etc. on there. Remember that it will be dark though!
 * It has become easier to re-use Custom Materials:
   + Instead of having to configure each custom material separately, every place where a custom material is used now shows a list of existing custom materials, with a button to Add a new material and a button to Edit the selected material
   + When you Edit a custom material, it applies to every place where that material is used!
   + In addition, the custom material edit screen now has buttons to Save the material to a file or to Load the material from a file. This allows for exchanging materials between worlds, etc.
   + The list of available custom materials also includes the Custom Terrain Types, and you can select from existing Custom Materials for Custom Terrain Types
 * Explicit support was added for some new features of Minecraft 1.8:
   + WorldPainter now tells Minecraft that the map is already lighted, causing it to be loaded much quicker
   + There is a new terrain type called "Stone Mix", which consists of a mix of Stone, Granite, Diorite and Andesite, in approximately the same proportions as in Minecraft-generated maps
   + The default underground material for new worlds is now Stone Mix instead of Stone
   + For solid stone of the new types, the terrain types Granite, Diorite and Andesite have been added
   + In addition a terrain type for Red Sandstone has been added
   + Custom Object Layers can correctly rotate and mirror the new blocks
   + The new Hardcore game type can now be selected on the Export screen
 * The view grid has been made a bit more useful:
   + When the grid is enabled (grid icon in toolbar, or View -> Configure View...), WorldPainter now shows coordinate labels along the top and left view edges so it's easier to see at a glance where you are
   + Region borders have a dashes instead of dotted line so it's easier to see where they are. This aids in creating or exporting maps one region at a time. *Note* that this is only enabled if the grid size is a power to two so that there is actually a grid line at each region border
   + The tile selection windows (on the Export screen, the Merge screen and the Add/Remove Tiles screen) now have the grid enabled so it's easier to know exactly which tiles you are selecting
 * The "fill with layer" operation of the Global Operations tool now leaves the existing layer alone; the layer is added wherever the filter allows it, but the layer is not removed where it already exists. To get the old behaviour, manually remove the layer first with the "remove a layer" operation
 * It is now possible to remove previously added Nether and End dimensions from WorldPainter worlds, using the actions in the Edit menu
 * Improved the Custom Plants layer configuration screen so that the layout is better and things don't jump around when enabling or disabling plants
 * The difficulty can now be set on the Export screen. For the Hardcore game type is is locked to Hard
 * The scripting engine now checks that you don't forget to use go(), hopefully helping beginners to avoid making this mistake
 * Bug fix: the Merge process no longer leaves carrots and potatoes to exist under water
 * Bug fix: the Merge process no longer leaves top halves of double-high plants, cactuses or sugar canes in the map if the bottom half got removed for some reason (flooding, for instance)
 * Bug fix: fix the Custom Plants layer type so that specifying the maturity of plants (the "growth") works correctly for the lowest and highest values
 * Bug fix: when merging with a map which is substantially higher than the world being merged, don't omit the above ground portion from the world being merged

-- Version 1.10.6, released 7-3-2015

 * Added wpscript command line tool, which is added to the PATH so that it is always available on the command line, to make it easier to run WorldPainter scripts without having to write your own script launcher first
 * Upgraded JIDE docking framework to latest version
 * The Linux dep and rpm packages now install WorldPainter in the applications menu (in the Games categorie) so it is easier to find after installation
 * Bug fix: restore some missing libraries for better look and feel on Linux, and for dark look and feels

-- Version 1.10.5, released 1-3-2015

 * It is now possible to enable both "only on" and "except on" at the same time in the brush options. This includes the Global Operations screen, and filters created in the scripting engine. The "except on" setting takes precedence; in other words: if a location matches both the "only on" and "except on" filters the operation will *not* be applied.
 * If there are more than fifteen custom layers configured, split them into submenus by palette in the "only on" and "except on" menus to try and prevent the menu from becoming so long that it doesn't fit on the screen.
 * Support Minecraft 1.8.3 jar for biome calculations
 * Ignore invalid Minecraft profiles created by OptiFine mod while finding Minecraft jars. Will prevent errors for people trying to open the Biomes Viewer with Optifine installed

-- Version 1.10.4, released 4-1-2015

 * Support 1.8.1 jar for biome calculations
 * When loading the custom brushes at start-up, if there is a problem with one, just skip it instead of giving an error message. An error will be logged in the log file (%APPDATA%\WorldPainter\logfile0.txt on Windows)
 * Bug fix: make the Biomes Viewer work with Minecraft 1.8
 * Bug fix: don't crash if Exporting a world takes less than one second
 * Bug fix: don't crash when saving a world, or performing other operations on it, of which the maximum height has been changed from 256 or below to higher, or vice versa

-- Version 1.10.3, released 26-10-2014

 * Added lily pad support to the Custom Plants layer
 * Support 1.8 jar for biome calculations, and rename 1.7 to 1.8 in user interface. Full support for new 1.8 blocks and features coming later
 * Added advanced mechanism for specifying block IDs on which the Frost layer must not place snow. See this wiki page for details: http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/AdvancedSettings

-- Version 1.10.2, released 12-9-2014

 * Scripting engine: added support for mapping colours to layer or terrain values, allowing the use of terrain type maps to set the terrain, biome, etc.. See the scripting API page for details: http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/Scripting/API

-- Version 1.10.1, released 12-9-2014

 * Better error handling when loading and scaling overlay images
 * Scripting engine: added support for filtering with the same kind of filters as are possible in the GUI using the brush settings panel (slope, terrain height, terrain type, layer, water, land, etc.). The filters can be combined with a height map, or can be applied on their own to a layer or terrain type. See the scripting API page for details: http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/Scripting/API. PLEASE NOTE: just like in the GUI, filtering on slope only works well on worlds created from high resolution (16-bit) height maps, or sculpted manually in WorldPainter!
 * Scripting engine: bug fix: wp.saveWorld() always resulted in a "world may not be null" error; this has been fixed

-- Version 1.10.0, released 5-9-2014

 * Added a new custom layer type: Custom Plants layers. They allow you to create layers with a custom mix of any type of plant (single or double height), crop or sapling. At any stage (or range of stages) of growth. For crops it can automatically turn the grass or dirt underneath it to tilled dirt, to create fields of crops easily. The layer is a binary (on/off, like Frost) layer instead of an intensity based layer such as custom object layers, giving you full control over where plants will occur. Layer present => plant present (unless the terrain type doesn't allow it)
 * Added Quartz to the Resources layer. For the surface dimension, and for existing worlds, it is set to 0‰ by default (in other words: no quartz). For newly added Nether dimensions it will be set to 6‰, which is the approximate frequency of quartz in Minecraft. For existing worlds with a Nether you will need to set the frequency manually, if you want there to be quartz in it
 * Introducing the scripting engine. For now it supports exporting worlds, creating worlds from height maps, and applying height maps as layers or terrain types (something which isn't possible in the GUI). Note that the scripting engine is UNSUPPORTED! You can find more information online: http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/Scripting
 * Renamed block ID 95 to "Stained Glass" (it was named "Locked Chest", which it used to be in the 2011 April Fools edition of Minecraft)
 * The way region boundary fixups are performed has changed. Instead of at the end of the export they are now done during the export, making the time remaining estimate more reliable and hopefully preventing some hangs and crashes when exporting very large worlds. It is possible that exporting large worlds with extensive Custom Object Layer usage may be slightly slower
 * The maximum offset of the image overlay has been increased to 999,999, to be consistent with the height map import functionality
 * Bug fix: when creating a new world from an offset height map, or from a tile selection, scroll to it in the editor when first displayed
 * Bug fix: fix garbage trails behind the brush due to the brush being drawn off-centre, by working around a docking framework bug
 * Bug fix: fix a long standing bug in the random noise generator. This will have consequences for existing worlds! Hills will be slightly lower, chasms and caverns slightly smaller, etc. It will hardly be noticeable in new worlds, but if you use WorldPainter to expand an existing world you might find that hills, caverns, chasms, etc. will not line up exactly any more between the new and old parts. Version 1.9.3 will remain available if it is necessary to export old worlds exactly as they were previously exported
 * Bug fix: resources with a low occurrence are now exported (at the correct frequency) even when the layer is painted at less than 50% intensity. Note that the intensity response of the Resources layer has changed slightly as a result. At 1% intensity, the resource frequency will be about 1/8th of the configured value; at 50% it will be exactly the configured value (like it is now) and at 100% it will be twice the configured value
 * Bug fix: the Chasms and Caverns layers now take the actual top layer depth into account (chasms and caverns never protrude into the top layer), instead of assuming a top layer depth of three blocks; they will still stay at least three blocks beneath the surface though (if "break the surface" is not selected of course)
 * Bug fix: don't crash when exporting custom objects with tile entities (chests, etc.) that end up below bedrock or above the map height

-- Version 1.9.3, released 29-7-2014

 * The image overlay painting code has been tweaked in an attempt to solve the lag problem some people are experiencing
 * Bug fix: make exporting a world as an image work again if it contains lava

-- Version 1.9.2, released 6-7-2014

 * When loading a pre-1.9.2 world, WorldPainter now offers to fix the overlay offsets, which were stored incorrectly in versions prior to 1.9.0. The reason it asks instead of always fixing it automatically is because you might have already fixed them manually in version 1.9.0 or 1.9.1
 * When using Void (including the edges of circular worlds), whenever it is adjacent to water WorldPainter now pregenerates water cascading into the void, preventing long pauses as Minecraft loads the chunks
 * Bug fix: fix "juddering" and misalignment of brush outline and overlay image when zoomed in, and associated "trails" behind the brush when moving it

-- Version 1.9.1, released 28-6-2014

 * Improve the handling of the occurrences colum on the Custom Material editing screen. It now tries its best to keep the proportions of the other materials the same as you add, remove or change the occurrence of materials. In addition, the restriction on removing, or changing the occurrence of, the first row has been removed
 * Give a clear error message when trying to run on Java 6 on Linux
 * Error handling during loading of configuration, loading of Minecraft jars and importing of corrupted Minecraft maps has been made a bit more robust. WorldPainter will try to continue if it can instead of giving an error message
 * Bug fix: make exporting the world as an image work again
 * Bug fix: prevent collapse of status bar fields when starting WorldPainter by opening a .world file
 * Bug fix: make changing the contour line separation work again
 * Bug fix: don't crash when adding material to a Custom Material for which the total of the occurrences of all rows but the first is more than 900
 * Bug fix: don't try to extend vines down into the void, causing errors during Export or Merge

-- Version 1.9.0, released 22-6-2014

 * Performance improvements:
   - The editor now uses tile based painting instead of maintaining one large image of the entire world. This increases performance when working at highly zoomed out levels, makes creating and loading large worlds faster and conserves memory, making it possible to create larger worlds, and works around a Java bug that causes display corruption for large worlds
   - Creating large new worlds now takes advantage of multiple cores, significantly speeding up the process for multicore CPU's
   - The performance of the Export process has been improved. Exports should be noticeably quicker
 * The editor now displays the configured border, and if it can find a compatible Minecraft.jar file also the Minecraft biomes outside the border, so you can better judge how the map integrates into the Minecraft world:
   - The border, if any, is separated from the map by a dotted line so you can see where the map ends and the border begins
   - The biomes outside the border are shown in faded colours to distinguish them from the generated portion of the map
   - The scrollbars only allow scrolling within the area of the actual WorldPainter world, but you can get to the surrounding areas by panning the map with the middle mouse button or the space bar
   - The status bar will tell you when the mouse is over the border, or over the Minecraft generated area outside the border
 * The visual style of the application can be changed to a number of different looks from the Preferences screen, including two dark themes
 * Some basic bulk modifications are now available for existing maps: you can remove trees and/or other vegetation, remove man made structures, remove resources/ores and fill in caves. The options are on the Merge screen. You can control *where* these modifications will be performed using the Read-Only layer and or the tile selection on the Merge screen. The modifications are performed *before* the WorldPainter layers are applied, so you can use them to replace trees or ores, etc.
 * The Custom Underground Pockets layer has been improved; instead of a simple material it is now possible to configure either a custom (mixed) material, or a terrain type, allowing you to use things like Mesa which aren't possible to do with a mixed material. Note that you can set the occurrence to 1000‰ to completely replace the underground material. This can be used to locally replicate the "keep steep terrain covered" effect without enabling it for the entire map
 * Some Custom Material/Custom Terrain related changes:
   - Custom Materials/Custom Terrains can now consist of layers in addition to blobs or noise, so you can make your own Mesa-like custom terrain types. The layers can repeat, or not, and can have random variation applied to them as well as be angled away from the horizontal
   - The Custom Material screen now shows a preview of the material so you can better judge the settings
 * Custom layers are now saved with the world even if they aren't currently in use, so that they are still there when you next load the world
 * Some new ways of working with Automatic Biomes have been added:
   - There is a new Auto Biomes submenu under Biomes in the "only on" and "except on" menus on the Brush Settings panel. It allows you to filter on a particular automatic biome, or on *all* automatic biomes.
   - The same applies to the Global Operations screen. If you want to apply an operation to all biomes of a specific type, manual *and* auto, you'll have to perform the operation twice: once for the manual biome and once for the auto biome.
   - A new "make automatic biomes permanent" option has been added to the Global Operations screen, which will fix all the automatic biomes and make them manual biomes. Of course after this operation the biomes will not be automatically updated any more as you edit the world; you become fully responsible yourself for editing the biomes as needed.
 * The zoom level is now restricted between 6% and 6400%
 * Extended block ID's are now supported for schematics
 * Incomplete double high plants are more thoroughly removed, however they came to be, to prevent invisible but breakable blocks
 * Unknown blocks are treated as being fully transparent during lighting calculations, which should create fewer visible lighting bugs
 * When exporting custom objects, if unknown tile entities are encountered these are now exported instead of causing an error. PLEASE NOTE: WorldPainter can't verify that the corresponding block still exists; if it doesn't, the map could cause Minecraft to crash!
 * The Minecraft 1.7.9 jar file is now supported for the Biomes Viewer
 * The Minecraft jars are now only scanned once, when the program is started. If you upgrade Minecraft or otherwise change something that would affect a Minecraft jar that WorldPainter might use, you should restart WorldPainter or risk getting errors
 * Some small cosmetic changes:
   - Biome ID's are more prominently displayed on the status bar and the Biomes palette
   - Layer intensity is shown as a percentage on the status bar to correspond to the intensity slider setting used when painting it
   - "Show" and "Solo" labels added above the checkboxes on the layer palettes to make it more clear what they do
   - Unknown block types are shown in cyan instead of black to differentiate them from for instance Bedrock or Obsidian
 * Bug fix: don't respond to Alt+left mouse button drag for panning the map. The correct way to pan the map is to press the middle mouse button (mouse wheel) or the space bar
 * Bug fix: round all values below 128 up to 128 for the width and height on the New World screen
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when annotating text that was too long
 * Bug fix: properly place rotated multi line text
 * Bug fix: don't allow selection of non-existent tiles on Merge and Export screens
 * Bug fix: prevent an error that sometimes occured when exporting resources on maps which go all the way up to the maximum height
 * Bug fix: prevent an error that occured when setting a layer factor higher than 100% in the settings of a Combined Layer

-- Version 1.8.5, released 19-3-2014

 * Don't put snow on packed ice blocks, since Minecraft does not allow that
 * The Deep Snow terrain type no longer has thin Snow on top. This is to facilitate easier generation of ice spikes by setting the biome to Ice Plains Spikes and painting Populate in the same area. Of course if you use the Frost layer in the same area, that will still place Snow and prevent ice spikes from forming!
 * Bug fix: don't crash upon encountering unknown tile entities in schematics; instead log a warning in the log file. Note that for unknown tile entities WorldPainter can't check whether the corresponding block still exists. If it doesn't (because it was replaced by something else, for instance), Minecraft may crash
 * Bug fix: configuring a colour for the material of a Custom Ground Cover layer would result in an error; this has been fixed

-- Version 1.8.4, released 16-3-2014

 * It is now possible to replace a particular block type in custom objects with air when placing the object:
   - The Edit Object Attributes screen now has a new checkbox called "replace with air". If you select it you can then specify a block ID and data value
   - By default the block ID is set to 35 and the data value to 2, which is Magenta Wool, but you can use any block type you want
   - For objects where this option is active, any blocks in the object with the specified ID and data value will be replaced with air when the objects is rendered
   - Note that for the collision calculations the original block type is used
   - One way to use this is to create dungeons or other hollow spaces underground with schematics, something which was not previously possible. Just replace the air blocks with magenta wool blocks before exporting the schematic, and activate the "replace with air" option in WorldPainter
   - Another way to use this is to expand the "collision envelope" of objects, in other words increase the guaranteed distance from other objects, by placing a few Magenta Wool blocks as a buffer around the outside of the object, which will collide with solid blocks, but rendered as air
 * The tool panels and palettes now use the JIDE Docking Framework for much improved management and organisation
   - When a world is saved WorldPainter will remember the workspace layout (in its own settings, not in the .world file, so they will not travel with the file) and will restore it when you load the world again
   - You can also set the default workspace layout from the menu: View -> Save workspace layout
   - By default custom layer palettes are tabbed with the regular Layers palette, and the custom brush palettes are tabbed with the regular Brushes palette, but you can drag them away and create your own layout of panes and/or tabs for optimum convenience
   - Panels can be moved and docked in various places by dragging the title bar (which will move all the tabs), or by dragging the individual tabs
   - Panels can be floated by clicking the float icon on their titlebar, or by dragging them onto the editor, or out of the window. They can be unfloated by clicking the unfloat icon
   - Panels can be set to autohide by clicking the pin icon
   - Panels can be dragged onto a workspace edge to create a new pane, onto the titlebar of an existing pane to add a tab, or in between panes to insert a new pane between the existing ones
   - If you want to move all tabs but one to a new pane it's easier to first drag the entire pane to a new location, and then drag only the one tab which you wish to remain in its original location back
   - If you mess up the layout or lose a panel you can restore to factory defaults from the menu: View -> Reset workspace layout
 * The default export settings (world type, game mode, etc.) can now be configured on the Preferences screen (Edit menu)
 * Worlds created from height maps now inherit more default settings from the Preferences screen (such as the default export settings and the default border, surface layer depth, bottomless world and layer configuration settings)
 * Bedrock walls are now solid bedrock (instead of being hollow in the middle), to avoid triggering a bug in Minecraft
 * Bug fix: don't export custom terrains with incorrect biome ID's, causing Minecraft to crash. Unfortunately such worlds will have to be reexported to fix the biomes
 * Bug fix: the Grass terrain type should no longer render empty but breakable blocks on top of some tall grass blocks
 * Bug fix: when importing a height map don't turn pixels with value 0 into void (unless requested)
 * Bug fix: when importing a height map correctly initialise the default water level to the stored defaults
 * Bug fix: remove tile entity data for tile entities (chests, etc.) which did not end up in the exported map (because they were replaced by something else, for instance) to prevent Minecraft crashes

-- Version 1.8.3, released 24-2-2014

 * Bug fix: make importing height maps work again without generating an error message

-- Version 1.8.2, released 23-2-2014

 * The Grass terrain type (which is the default terrain type) now generates the new flowers and double high plants of Minecraft 1.7. It generates as many flowers and as much grass as previously, but anywhere it previously generated a dandelion or poppy it can now generate any flower (including double high ones), and anywhere it previously generated tall grass or ferns it can now also generate double high grass or ferns
 * Zoom support has been added to the 3D view. Note that it is a simple zoom; i.e. it just enlarges the pixels. No additional detail will be visible when zooming in. You can zoom in or out by pressing the - or + buttons on the keyboard, by scrolling the mouse wheel or by using the new toolbar buttons. You can zoom a maximum of three levels in either direction. Note that zooming out large worlds will cost a lot of memory and performance!

-- Version 1.8.1, released 17-2-2014

 * Bug fix: make the Global Operations tool work again, without hanging WorldPainter
 * Bug fix: merging maps with Mesa terrain now works correctly, without building higher and higher columns of clay

-- Version 1.8.0, released 16-2-2014

 * A new feature has been added: Annotations. They allow you to add lines (both straight and free form) and text to the map view as guides or reminders. It has the following properties:
   - Activate by selecting the Annotations layer button. An options panel will be displayed which allows you to select a tool and a colour.
   - The Pencil tool allows you to draw lines and to erase annotations
     + It uses the shape and size of the brush. By reducing the brush radius all the way to zero you can draw single pixel lines
     + Click one with the Pencil tool to draw a single point
     + Click and drag with the left mouse button to draw a free form line
     + Press Shift while clicking with the left mouse button to draw a straight line from the last point you drew
     + Press Ctrl and Shift while clicking with the left mouse button to draw a straight line from the last point you drew, snapped to the nearest 45 degree angle
     + Press Ctrl and drag with the left mouse button to draw a straight free form line, snapped to the nearest 45 degree angle
     + You can do all of the above with the right mouse button instead of the left to erase annotations instead of drawing. You might want to use a larger brush size for that
   - The Text tool allows you to draw text
     + Select it and left click where you want to place the text
     + A dialog box will appear allowing you to enter the text you want to draw, as well as select a font, font size, bold and/or italics, and angle (allowing you to draw the text on its side or upside down)
     + The text may have multiple lines
     + Note that if you select a different angle than zero degrees, the text will be rotated around the point where you clicked. In other words, if for instance you selected 180 degrees, the text will be placed above and to the left of where you clicked
   - The colour palette determines the colour of any lines or text you draw
   - You can erase annotations by right clicking with the Pencil tool (use a larger brush size for convenience)
   - The Annotations layer is mainly meant for creating guides and reminders for the world creation process, not for actual exporting to the Minecraft map. However, it *is* possible to do that by checking the "export the annotations" checkbox on the Other Layers tab of the Export or Dimension Properties screens. The annotations will be exported as coloured wool on top of the landscape
 * The height map import dialog has been slightly improved:
   - The settings on the Terrain tab can now be saved as defaults, so you don't have to keep changing them if you use the same settings a lot
   - It once again supports importing RGB ("colour") images. Note that only the red channel will be used!
   - It now properly supports 16-bit height maps (height maps with 65536 discrete values per pixel, instead of 256). Such height maps can be used in two ways:
     + Creating worlds higher than 256 blocks. WorldPainter automatically chooses this mode if the highest value in the image is below 2048. Otherwise WorldPainter chooses the next mode by default:
     + "High resolution" world creation: a world with a normal 256 world height, but with additional resolution to the height information, resulting in better looking Smooth Snow (which will be turned on by default, as opposed to normal "low res" height maps), and smoother terrain operations. The additional resolution does not show up in Minecraft (other than in the Smooth Snow), but it makes editing the world after importing the height map work better
   - Note that it does not support scaling for grey scale images with alpha channels. Remove the alpha channel from such images using a program such as GIMP or PhotoShop in order to be able to scale it in WorldPainter
 * Bug fix: tile entities (chests, signs, etc.) from schematics are now correctly placed, even if the schematic has a non-zero offset
   - Note that there is a bug in WorldEdit causing it not to include paintings or item frames in exported schematics. They will be lost, but there is nothing WorldPainter can do about that unfortunately
   - There are a few known bugs which will be fixed in the future:
     + Severed heads aren't supported; both the rotation and the type of head will be lost
     + Rail track corners aren't rotated properly

-- Version 1.7.1, released 1-12-2013

 * Made the terrain type menu on the brush filter panel shorter by breaking off the stained clays and the custom terrain types into their own sub menus
 * The default "ocean" and "land" seeds have changed to seeds which work with Minecraft 1.7's new biome algorithm (but therefore are no longer correct for Minecraft 1.6). Note that Minecraft 1.7 has no large oceans any more, so even the default "ocean" seed will only result in a relatively small ocean around the origin (the nearest land is approximately 1400 blocks away)
 * Made several small usability improvements and bug fixes to the Biomes Viewer
 * Bug fix: actually use the custom terrain colours, when configured, in the editor

-- Version 1.7.0, released 30-11-2013

 * Added support for Minecraft 1.7 biomes in various places:
   - The Biomes layer
   - The Biomes Viewer tool
   - Because there are so many biomes now the Biomes panel has been refactored. Instead of having buttons for all biomes there are, it has buttons for the base biomes (to which have been added Birch Forest, Roofed Forest, Mega Taiga, Mega Spruce Taiga, Savanna, Mesa, Stone Beach, Cold Beach and Cold Taiga) and checkboxes for a number of options ("hills/shore", "edge/plateau", "M", "F" and "variant"). The "variant" option is for things like Flower Forest, Extreme Hills+, Mesa (Bryce) and Ice Plains Spikes
 * Various changes were made to the Custom and Automatic Biomes support:
   - The legacy biomes support (where WorldPainter would calculate the biomes according to the Minecraft seed) has been removed
   - Custom Biomes is now *always* enabled (and therefore the option has been removed). Note that if you export a world to the MCRegion (Minecraft 1.1 and earlier) format the biome information will not be exported and therefore be ignored!
   - Automatic Biomes have been refactored and work differently. It is no longer an option; instead it is always available. New worlds are initialised to have automatic biomes everywhere, which you can override by painting biomes manually with the Biomes layer. To reset to Automatic Biomes, right-click with the Biomes layer (it doesn't matter which biome you have selected), or use the Global Operations tool to reset it everywhere. Automatic Biomes will now no longer overwrite your manual changes whenever you edit the terrain or the layers
   - Existing worlds may have Automatic Biomes enabled if it was disabled, or disabled if it was enabled, depending on exactly which options were enabled previously. WorldPainter will warn you when it does this. For more information, including how to disable or reenable Automatic Biomes, see this web page: http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/NewAutomaticBiomes
 * The colour schemes have been updated and expanded for Minecraft 1.7:
   - The default colour scheme has been altered to more accurately represent the actual colours in Minecraft. You can change the colour scheme from the View menu
   - Some more colour schemes have been added, corresponding to popular texture packs: DokuDark, DokuHigh and DokuLight (DokuCraft), Misa (Realistic) and Sphax (PureBDCraft)
   - With thanks to mikeprimm from Dynmap!
 * The terrain types were also updated for Minecraft 1.7:
   - Added new terrain types for the new Minecraft 1.7 biomes. The simple terrain types (which consist of a single block type throughout) added are: Permadirt (Dirt on which grass won't grow), Podzol, Red Sand, Hardened Clay and all sixteen colours of Stained Clay. When Importing a Minecraft map WorldPainter will now use these new terrain types
   - In addition, two new complex terrain types have been added: Mesa and Red Desert. Mesa consist of random horizontal layers of Hardened Clay, Red Sand and White, Yellow, Orange, Light Grey, Red and Brown Stained Clay. The layers vary up and down randomly and on top are many dead shrubs. The associated Automatic Biome is Mesa. The second complex terrain type is Red Desert, which is very similar to Desert, except that it places Red Sand, has fewer cactuses and the associated Automatic Biome is also Mesa
   - The Terrains panel has changed to accomodate the new terrain types. Dirt has been replaced with Permadirt (the idea is that if you are placing Dirt manually you most likely want it to stay Dirt). Podzol, Red Sand and Hardened Clay have been added, as well as Mesa and Red Desert. Resources has been removed. An extra More Terrains panel has been added, which can be opened with the new + button on the Terrains panel, and which contains all the Stained Clays
 * You can now donate bitcoins! If you find WorldPainter fun or useful, or you make money with it, please consider donating an amount of your choice. The bitcoin address for donations is: XXX
 * WorldPainter now targets Minecraft 1.7 in principle. While the map format has not changed and it can still generate Minecraft 1.6 compatible maps in principle, you have to make sure yourself not to use any block types or biomes which Minecraft 1.6 does not support, if you are targeting Minecraft 1.6. Note that Automatic Biomes (which is used by default on new worlds) *will* choose biomes which Minecraft 1.6 does not support, so you will have to paint the biomes manually. See http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/NewAutomaticBiomes for more information. WorldPainter 1.6.7 will also remain available
 * Bug fix: make painting custom terrain types work correctly again (the wrong terrain was being painted)
 * Bug fix: some small zoom related bugs were fixed in tile selection screens

-- Version 1.6.7, released 15-11-2013

 * Bug fix: fix an error while importing a map that was caused by encountering a Dirt or Sand block with an unknown data value. Such blocks will now be counted as regular Dirt or Sand blocks (with a data value of zero)
 * Bug fix: make changing the colour of custom terrain types work again

-- Version 1.6.6, released 10-11-2013

 * New feature: layer palettes! This allows you to group custom layers together on separate palettes, alleviating the problem that if you have too many custom layers they don't fit on the screen any more. To use: right-click on a layer button, choose "Move to palette", then choose the name of an existing palette or "New palette" to create a new one. In the future you will be able to hide and/or collapse these palettes, but as of now that is not yet possible
 * New option: "keep steep terrain covered". It's on the Dimension Properties/Export screen next to the top layer depth settings. It is on by default for new worlds; for existing worlds it remains off. It does what it says: it makes sure that the surface layer is extended downwards on steep terrain as much as needed to prevent the subsurface material from being visible. It prevents the stone underground showing through on cliffs and steep mountain sides, for instance. If you *want* that effect you can of course turn it off
 * It is now possible to select custom biomes for the "only on" or "except on" brush filter settings
 * Added support (names, light calculation, rotation and mirroring, etc.) for new blocks in Minecraft 1.7
 * When importing existing Minecraft maps, as a temporary solution until full Minecraft 1.7 support arrives, WorldPainter will create custom terrain types for the new biome surface blocks (red sand, hardened clay, stained clay, permadirt and podzol) so these biomes can be more or less correctly imported and edited
 * New import option: when importing an existing map there is a new setting (which is also the new default) for when to mark chunks read only: "chunks with man made blocks *above ground*". This will prevent chunks from being marked read only just because there are underground structures such as abandoned mines or strongholds. The old option of man made chunks at any level is also still available
 * WorldPainter will try to remove blocks that would pop off in Minecraft anyway because they are placed on invalid blocks. It already did this for some block types (for instance flowers on anything but Grass or Dirt blocks), but it has been expanded to include Snow and Wheat blocks. Other invalid configurations will be added in the future. The reason is that large areas of these invalid block configurations have been known to crash Minecraft upon loading the map or entering the area
 * Bug fix: make the "bottomless world" option work with the Cave/Tunnel layer

-- Version 1.6.5, released 28-10-2013

 * Bug fix: fixed a bug that prevented multiple ground cover layers in the same location from being exported if they had the same thickness
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when importing a Combined Layer which refers to a Custom Terrain which is not present in the current world. For existing Combined Layers, the Custom Terrain setting has been lost and a warning will be displayed. For Combined Layers exported from now on, the Custom Terrain settings will be saved with the layer, and restored when it is imported
 * Bug fix: don't remove red or brown mushrooms from mycelium blocks
 * Bug fix: wheat no longer replaces water when used in a Custom Ground Cover layer
 * Bug fix: make the bedrock wall option work again when no border is selected
 * Bug fix: select the correct radiobutton for configured materials when editing existing Cave/Tunnel layers
 * Various small bug fixes

-- Version 1.6.4, released 25-9-2013

 * Bug fix: make importing existing Minecraft maps work again. Sorry about that!
 * Bug fix: make tile selection on the Export screen work for Nether and End

-- Version 1.6.3, released 22-9-2013

 * The Custom Ground Cover layer type has been expanded with more settings, making it more powerful:
   - Instead of a simple block ID and data value the material can now be a complex custom material with a mix of block ID's
   - The thickness setting can now be negative, which will cause the layer to dig into the ground, instead of being placed on top of it
   - The edges of the layer can now be shaped in different ways. There is an edge shape and an edge width setting. The shapes are as follows:
     + Sheer - the layer has a constant height right up to the edge; the edges are completely sheer. The edge width is ignored for this shape
     + Linear - the edge forms a diagonal but straight line down to the ground. For an exact 45 degree angle, set the edge width to one less than the layer thickness
     + Smooth - the edge forms a sinuous, smooth shape which meets the ground and the top horizontally with a smooth transition in between
     + Rounded - the edge forms a quarter circle, meeting the top horizontally and the ground vertically with a smooth transition in between
   - Of course these shapes will only become apparent at higher thicknesses and edge widths! Minecraft's blocky nature means that for thin layers and edges the difference will be negligible
   - A random variation can now be added to the thickness, with the same settings as used in the Caves/Tunnels layer. The randomness is applied to the flat sections as well as the edges
   - All these new settings can be combined to do things like add glaciers (with or without deep snow on top), rivers including a riverbed, holes in the ground (by using Air as the material), etc., etc.
   - All existing ground cover layers will by default get an edge width of one, and an edge shape of "sheer" (if the thickness is one) or "rounded" (if the thickness is more than one). For one block thick layers there will be no change in behaviour, but layers with a higher thickness will have different looking edges, so you should inspect those
 * A new brush type has been added: Dome. This has the shape of a half sphere. If you start with a flat surface, and raise the ground until the center is raised (or lowered) exactly the same amount as the brush radius, the resulting shape will be an exact half sphere. (This was already added in the previous release, but was omitted from the release notes)

-- Version 1.6.2, released 20-9-2013

 * The accuracy of the brush has been improved for small brush sizes and when zoomed in, making it easier to work on small details. As long as the brush is not rotated, or rotated at a 90 degree angle, the brush now indicates *exactly* which blocks will be affected even when zoomed in and with small brush sizes. For round brushes it is only the blocks which lie completely inside the circle
   - In a related change, the brush may now have a radius of zero, which affects only the block the mouse cursor is on, for even more detailed work
   - The spawn point marker is also drawn more accurately across the actual block where you will spawn
 * The Caves/Tunnels layer behaviour has changed slightly with respect to the absolute minimum and maximum heights for floor and ceiling. The noise, if any, is now applied *after* the minimum and maximum, so that the level sections of the cave still have random variation applied, instead of being perfectly flat
 * It is now possible to create separate palettes for custom brushes, by placing them in subdirectories inside the custom brush directory (which you can open from the Tools menu). The name of each subdirectory will be used as the name of the palette. In the near future this will be expanded with the possibility of collapsing palettes, and creating palettes for custom layers
 * After exporting a world some statistics about its total area, size on disk, export speed, etc. are displayed
 * Bug fix: fixed a small irregularity in Smooth Snow, making it *slightly* smoother

-- Version 1.6.1, released 15-9-2013

 * Added some new options for the Caves/Tunnels layer:
   - "Remove water or lava" option - off by default (including existing layers) - when off, water (or lava) will not be removed, and floor, wall and roof materials will not be placed in water. When on, water will be removed, and floor, wall and roof materials will be placed underwater. Note: this only applies to water or lava from WorldPainter's Flood tool, not to water from the Resources layer or some custom layer. Turn this on and use Glass for all materials to create underwater habitats, for example
   - "Flood the caves/tunnels" option - off by default (including existing layers) - when turned on, the caves or tunnels created by that layer will be flooded. You can specify the level to which it should be flooded, and whether it should be flooded with water or lava
 * Added some keyboard and mouse controls for the brush rotation:
   - Pressing Alt while rotating the mouse wheel will rotate the brush fifteen degrees counterclockwise (when scrolling up) or clockwise (when scrolling down)
   - Alt+0 (on the main keyboard or numeric keypad) will reset the rotation to zero degrees
   - Alt+- and Alt++ (on the main keyboard or numeric keypad) will rotate the brush fifteen degrees counterclockwise or clockwise, respectively
   - Alt+3 (on the main keyboard or numeric keypad) will rotate the brush 30 degrees clockwise
   - Alt+4 (on the main keyboard or numeric keypad) will rotate the brush 45 degrees clockwise
   - Alt+9 (on the main keyboard or numeric keypad) will rotate the brush 90 degrees clockwise
 * Added some keyboard controls for finer control of the brush size:
   - Pressing Shift while rotating the mouse wheel will change the brush size by one pixel at a time
   - Shift+- and Shift++ (on the main keyboard or numeric keypad) will change the brush size by one pixel at a time
 * Bug fix: restored ability to remove Read Only layer with Global Operations tool

-- Version 1.6.0, released 10-9-2013

 * Brush rotation! Brushes can now be rotated from -180 to 180 degrees clockwise at 15 degree intervals using a new slider on the Brush Settings panel
 * Caves/Tunnels layer! A new custom layer type has been added which allows you to create underground caves and tunnels with specific elevations, shapes and floor/wall/ceiling materials. See http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/CavesAndTunnels for details
 * You can now change the spawn point from the tile selection screen on the Export screen, saving you from having to exit all the way out of the Export screen to change the spawn point
 * The way borders and bedrock walls are generated has changed for irregularly shaped worlds (including circular worlds). They used to form a rectangular shape around all the tiles, potentially being a huge distance away and greatly increasing the surface area and disk space requirements of the map. Now they are only generated around the tiles which are actually present, more closely following the shape of the world
 * When you use the Ocean Minecraft seed, the world type is now set to Large Biomes by default, to make an even larger ocean around your map
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when exporting a world with custom objects that dig into the ground placed at low altitudes
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when adding tiles to some existing worlds. Unfortunately for those worlds new tiles will be flat, as the information about what the landscape should like like was lost
 * Bug fix: the 3D view shows underground Grass, Mycelium and Tilled Earth blocks as Dirt, as they will be exported, and as it used to do previously

--- Version 1.5.5, released 23-8-2013

 * Bug fix: fix a bug introduced in version 1.5.4 which prevented some worlds from being loaded
 * Bug fix: fix a bug which prevented very old worlds from being loaded

--- Version 1.5.4, released 23-8-2013

 * Bug fix: fix a bug that prevented version 1.5.3 from loading worlds created in 1.5.2 or earlier and containing custom object layers
 * Bug fix: fix a bug that prevented editing the properties of existing custom object layers

--- Version 1.5.3, released 22-8-2013

 * The leaf decay behaviour for custom object layers has changed. The default value of the leaf decay setting is now "as exported", so by default the old behaviour is back where leaves will decay or not according to how the object creator created them. To make it easier to change that there is now a leaf decay settings section on the main layer settings panel, in addition to the one on the individual object settings panel. It shows whether or not the currently loaded objects have decaying leaves or not (or a mix), and allows you to override the default for all objects at once with one button click
 * Bug fix: hopefully implemented a workaround for an error some people get when enabling solo mode for some layers
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when creating or opening a world while having a layer soloed
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when creating or opening a world while having the Nether or End dimension active
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when soloing a layer on a dimension with contains lava

--- Version 1.5.2, released 12-8-2013

 * Bug fix: the long standing bug that left patches of water after canceling a Flood operation has *finally* been fixed!
 * Bug fix: a bug that prevented height maps that contained at least one pixel with value 0 from being imported at all, introduced in version 1.5.1, has been fixed

--- Version 1.5.1, released 11-8-2013

 * A few Frost related changes have been made to imported Minecraft maps and height maps:
   - Smooth snow is now turned off by default for imported height maps (it already was for Minecraft maps), but both are now imported in such a way that turning on smooth snow will not result in a half block thick layer of snow (it will be regular one layer thick). *Note* however that it still won't be smooth snow! Smooth snow is not compatible with imported worlds
   - The merge process had been tweaked so that it leaves *existing* smooth snow alone (as long as you haven't removed the Frost layer of course). Note that this may give strange effects if you changed the slope of the land
   - You can now remove snow and ice from an existing map by importing it, removing the Frost layer and merging it (making sure that the chunks where you want to remove snow and ice are not marked read-only)
 * Add support for Minecraft 1.6.2 jar file
 * Bug fix: fixed (hopefully) a nasty bug related to combined layers which would cause floods of NullPointerExceptions in unpredictable circumstances
 * Bug fix: the minimum and maximum Chasms layer settings in the Dimension Properties now work (and are saved)
 * Bug fix: a problem with the stored water level in world files has been fixed, which among other things makes the Sponge tool work correctly again for restoring the default water level by right-clicking
 * Bug fix: actually use the default top layer depth and bottomless world settings from the Preferences screen for newly created worlds

--- Version 1.5.0, released 21-7-2013

 * A new custom layer type has been added: "combined" layers. These allow you to combine a terrain type and/or a biome and/or one or more layers (both standard and custom) into one layer, making it easier to apply a number of layers at once in the same location.
   You have the option of hiding the layers that you add to the combined layer so they don't clutter up the layers panel. When you paint the layer your chosen terrain and/or biome (if any) are applied immediately; any layers you configured will be applied when the world is exported.
   You can also "apply" the layer (from the popup menu on the layer button), which will replace the combined layer with its constituent layers and make the changes permanent.
   You can use custom terrain types and biome IDs in combined layers, by defining the terrain type or biome ID first. They will be included in the selection menus when you add a new combined layer
 * Support for custom biome IDs has been added. To use it, "custom biomes" must be enabled (on the New World screen or from the Edit menu). Show the Biomes panel by clicking on the Biomes button, and then click on the + button to add a custom biome ID
 * A second column of "solo" checkboxes has been added in front of the layer buttons. Checking these will show only that layer, allowing you to quickly declutter the view
 * The brush options have been expanded with two new filters: slope and water/land. The slope filter allows you to apply an operation only to terrain above or below a certain slope, specified in degrees from horizontal. This is a good way to change the terrain type of cliffs and mountain sides to stone, for instance. The water and land choices in the "only on" and "except on" selection menus behave as you would expect
 * A new custom object setting has been added: leaf decay mode. This allows you to override the leaf decay behaviour of placed custom objects. By default (including existing custom object layers) it is set to "decay", meaning that all leaf blocks from the object will decay if there is no more wood nearby. You can also set it to "not decay" (should be obvious), or to "as exported", which is the old behaviour of placing the leaf blocks exactly as they are stored in the bo2 file or schematic. As with the other custom object settings you can change the setting for a number of objects at once by selecting them all in the list and clicking the Edit button next to the list
 * It is now possible to pan the view using the space bar in addition to the middle mouse button
 * The default behaviour of the Frost layer has changed to put snow and ice under trees (leaf or wood blocks), which it would not previously do. The setting can be changed on the Other Layers page of the Dimension Properties or Export screens. For existing worlds the old behaviour remains the default. Note that snow will always penetrate a single leaf or wood block, so there will still be snow around the edges and under thin canopies even with this setting turned off
 * Tilled Earth can now be used as a custom terrain type without crashing Minecraft, because WorldPainter will change all but the topmost Tilled Earth block to Dirt (like it already does for Grass and Mycelium blocks)
 * The Flood and Lava tools now don't change the fluid level when you click them (left or right) on a different fluid type. This makes it easier to change lava into water or vice versa without the risk of flooding the entire world
 * Allow changing the relative frequencies of multiple objects at once from the custom object screen
 * Bug fix: changing the scale of individual materials for custom terrain types set to "blobs" now works correctly
 * Bug fix: fix the names of some blocks newly added in Minecraft 1.6
 * Bug fix: correctly export metadata from tile entities in schematics. This makes it possible to place tile entities (chests, furnaces, mob spawners, etc.) with contents and configuration intact using schematics and a custom objects layer

--- Version 1.4.0, released 9-6-2013

 * Custom layers (of all types: objects, ground cover and underground pockets) can now be saved to and loaded from files on disk, allowing you to reuse them from world to world. Export from the layer's context menu (right-click on the layer button) and import from the File -> Import menu, or the + button on the layers panel. The files have a *.layer extension and can be sent to and used by anyone with WorldPainter version 1.4.0 or higher. Note that for custom object layers the object data is stored inside the layer file, so you don't need to keep or send the original object files separately
 * Custom terrain types can now be saved to and loaded from files on disk, allowing you to reuse them between worlds. Export and import custom terrains from the terrain's context menu (right-click on the custom terrain button). The files have a *.terrain extension and can be sent to and used by anyone with WorldPainter version 1.4.0 or higher
 * Added support block ID's between 255 and 4096, as used by various mods. The support can be enabled for each world individually from the New World screen, or later from the Edit menu, and the default can be set on the Preferences screen
 * Added twelve more custom terrain types, for a total of 24
 * Added support for Minecraft 1.5.2 jar file
 * Bug fix: fixed changing the height of the map for worlds loaded from disk

--- Version 1.3.1, released 12-5-2013

 * Bug fix: fix an error that would occur when trying to load or save a world when another world is already loaded, but not being displayed

--- Version 1.3.0, released 12-5-2013

 * Tile selections are now also supported for Merging, in addition to Exporting, making it easier to merge just part of a map, without having to mark everything read-only. This also fixes the problem that merging a world which has an active tile selection from an export operation only merges those tiles
 * The last view position is now remembered for each dimension, and will be restored any time the dimension is opened or switched to
 * Removed a feature which made it impossible to add tall grass or flowers to an existing map. This can now be done, preferably using Custom Ground Cover layers. Old imported worlds, with Grass instead of Bare Grass as the terrain type will now cause some random patches of tall grass and flowers to be added to existing maps, which would previously have been prevented
 * Custom objects will not be placed adjacent to each other (or to the terrain) if that would cause fence blocks to connect to other fence blocks or solid blocks, to avoid creating accidental fences. The same goes for nether brick fences, iron bars, cobblestone walls and glass panes
 * Bug fix: make the Mountain tool work with any brush. It still works best with brushes that smoothly flow to a bright peak somewhere near the middle though
 * Bug fix: an obscure bug that, if two custom layers had the same name and were both used within a tile, caused one of the layers not to be rendered in that tile, has been fixed. It's still a good idea to give custom layers different names though
 * Bug fix: don't warn about using both populate and superflat on export, if the preset contains the decoration tag

--- Version 1.3.0-RC2, released 9-5-2013

 * Bug fix: properly save the new custom terrain types with the world when a .world file is saved

--- Version 1.3.0-RC1, released 5-5-2013

 * The custom terrain types now allow more than one type of material, in either random pockets or completely random noise, with configurable frequencies and pocket sizes
 * Added seven more custom terrain types, for a total of twelve
 * Split up the toolbars to make them easier to use on small screens or with many custom layers and/or brushes
 * Added an offset/origin viewer to the offset adjustment screen for custom objects, to make it easier to see what you're doing when adjusting the offset
 * Made Beaches terrain type (and other terrain types with pockets of different materials, like Rock and Netherlike) more three dimensional (they vary going up and down instead of being the same all the way down from the surface)
 * Sand is now only supported with sandstone if it is floating over air. Sand on top of solid blocks will remain sand, so you have to be even more careful when digging straight up! This fixes the problem with thin layers of sand (for instance in beaches) turning to sandstone
 * Increased the maximum offset for overlay images tenfold
 * Bug fix: don't place snow on top of nonsensical blocks. Only solid blocks will receive snow on top of them
 * Bug fix: also apply Frost layer to custom objects placed along region boundaries. This fixes the strange snow-free grid lines through snowy custom object forests

--- Version 1.2.5, released 22-4-2013

 * Added more settings for custom objects:
   - "on air" will allow objects to spawn over Void
   - "on water" will allow objects to spawn on water (as opposed to under water on the floor). Note that such "floating" objects won't be placed if any solid blocks in the objects intersect the floor
   - "on lava" will similarly allow objects to spawn on lava
   - A "collide with" setting which allows you to control whether objects can overlap one another:
     + The default is "solid blocks", meaning objects won't be placed if a solid block from the object intersects with any existing solid (above ground) block
     + "any blocks" means that objects won't be placed if a solid block from the object intersects with any existing (above ground) block (except water, lava or air)
     + "nothing" means that the objects will always be placed, regardless of what is already there. This will allow objects to intersect, but also means existing objects will be partially cut off or replaced. Note that objects are always placed at ground (or water) level, never "on top" of each other
   - A "replace underground blocks" setting which allows you to control what happens if part of the object extends underground:
     + The default is "always", meaning every block that is present in the object (including air) will replace what is already there
     + "if object block is solid" means that only solid blocks from the object will be placed. This allows you for instance to create bushes with "underground" leaf blocks which will only be placed if the bush is placed on a cliff or a ledge and the "underground" part extends into the air
     + "if existing block is air" means that only air blocks (from caves, for instance) will be replaced with blocks from the object
 * Added a way to change the settings of multiple custom objects at once:
   - To change the settings of one object, double-click on it, or select it and press the Edit button to the right of the list
   - To change the settings of multiple objects, select them all and press the Edit button. The checkboxes will initially be in "indeterminate" state, meaning that the existing setting won't be changed (in case the setting is different among the selected objects). Change the value of any settings you want to apply to all selected objects and press OK
 * Added links to places where you can read about custom objects and block ID's and data values to various settings screens

--- Version 1.2.4, released 26-3-2013

 * Bug fix: resources that were set to 1 per mille in the Resources layer settings were not being exported at all; this has been fixed

--- Version 1.2.3, released 24-3-2013

 * Bug fix: fix a fatal error occuring during exports with certain layers active

--- Version 1.2.2, released 24-3-2013

 * Add support for Minecraft 1.5.1 jar and new block types
 * Bug fix: fix the empty seams along region borders in custom object layers
 * Bug fix: don't export resources that have been set to an occurence of zero
 * Bug fix: don't create unnecessary extra tiles when importing a height map that is a whole number of tiles big

--- Version 1.2.1, released 3-3-2013

 * Added an "except on" restriction to the brush, analogous to the "only on" option. Only one of the two can be selected at a time
 * Expand map import dialog to detect (and skip by default, although you can choose to include them) rogue outlying chunks, as well as show some statistics
 * Bug fix: export Nether and End dimensions with correct biomes

--- Version 1.2.0, released 1-2-2013

 * New feature: limit the brush to particular altitudes, terrain types, layers or biomes! An oft requested feature, this makes it possible to easily replace terrain types or biomes, or paint layers or terrain types only on certain levels. Note that the options have also been added to the Global Operations tool (Tools panel or press Ctrl+G), so you can easily paint a layer on certain altitudes or replace a terrain type worldwide in one go
 * New feature: it is now possible to limit the Caverns and Chasms layers to specific levels. For instance, you could set them to occur only from level 70 upwards so they only occur in mountains. Or you could have Caverns only low down in the map and Chasms all the way to the surface. Or any other combination
 * A major overhaul has been given to the custom object layer settings:
   - You can customise the origin of each object (use this to fix "floating" or "buried" objects)
   - You can indicate per object whether it may be rotated and mirrored randomly, and whether it can spawn in water or lava
   - You can change the relative frequecy of objects to make them more prevalent, or more rare, than the other objects in the layer (without having to add objects to the layer multiple times)
   - Because individual objects can now have different settings, you can no longer include a directory in the list. You can still select directories, but the objects from it will all be added to the list individually
   - You can explicitly choose to reload the objects from disk
   - Schematics can optionally contain an offset. If the schematic offset is present and points *inside* the object, it is used as the default WorldPainter offset. Otherwise WorldPainter makes an educated guess for the default offset. For bo2 objects the offset is always initialised to the offset stored in the file
 * Border tiles now include an ocean bottom. It is at more or less the same depth as in Minecraft, and consists of dirt, sand, clay and gravel on top and the subsurface material configured on the Export screen below. Any layers that have been selected to be applied everywhere (such as Caverns or Chasms) will also be applied to the border chunks. This feature was already present since version 1.1.0, but was not included in the release notes
 * Support Minecraft 1.4.7 minecraft.jar file in biomes viewer
 * Bug fix: import bo2 objects correctly rotated. This fixes mismatched vines, horizontal logs, etc.. If you are experiencing such problems you will have to reload those bo2 files in WorldPainter to fix them
 * Bug fix: disable inappropriate fields on New World screen
 * Bug fix: correct title of New World screen when adding Nether or End

--- Version 1.1.1, released 13-1-2013

 * Bug fix: make the bottomless map option actually operational

--- Version 1.1.0, released 13-1-2013

 * Added a new type of cave layer: Chasms! These are flat and windy, ravine-, chasm- or tunnellike caves. They are much smaller than the large, smooth caverns generated by the Caverns layer. You get the best effect if you use both cave layers, Caverns and Chasms, in the same area so they intersect
 * Add option to generate a bottomless map: a map with no bedrock at the bottom (so dig very carefully!) and with caverns and chasms open to the void at the bottom
 * Add option to configure the thickness of the surface layer
 * Removed warning when setting the spawn point lower than 63, since Minecraft no longer appears to be restricted by that
 * Bug fix: merge wall signs correctly

--- Version 1.0.3, released 16-11-2012

 * Maintenance release: fine-tune the statistics reported to WorldPainter HQ

--- Version 1.0.2, released 11-11-2012

 * Bug fix: fixed a major bug in version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 that prevented the program from starting up on new installs

--- Version 1.0.1, released 11-11-2012

 * Bug fix: fixed a major bug in version 1.0.0 that made it impossible to open existing .world files

--- Version 1.0.0, released 11-11-2012

 * WorldPainter is gold!!!
 * Added new terrain type: Bare Grass. As the name suggests, this is grass without any tall grass, ferns, flowers or sugar cane generated on top
 * The Grass, Desert and Beach terrain types will now randomly spawn sugar cane on blocks adjacent to water
 * There is a new Structures checkbox on the Export screen, which allows you to control the "generate structures" Minecraft option. *Please note:* it only applies when you use the Populate layer! It controls whether Minecraft will generate NPC villages, strongholds, abandoned mines, jungle temples and desert temples
 * Support for Minecraft biome schemes has been removed. You will still be able to load worlds which use a Minecraft biome scheme, but you cannot create new ones. If you want to see what the biomes will be *outside* the generated map, you can still use the biomes viewer for that
 * The only biomes related options are now Automatic Biomes and Custom Biomes. If you disable both, the biome will be Plains everywhere. Letting Minecraft calculate the biomes is no longer an option, because Minecraft behaves weirdly and occasionally crashes if no biomes are set at all
 * The Import and Merge processes have been made a bit more robust. If they encounter data corruption in the existing map they will try to continue importing or merging the rest of the map, although the problem chunks will be missing or damaged
 * When exporting a world with no automatic or custom biomes, the biomes are set to Plains everywhere, because Minecraft does weird things and crashes occasionally if no biomes are set at all
 * Bug fix: fixed a few errors that occurred when exporting worlds with extremely low or extremely high elevations
 * Bug fix: fixed an error that occurred when cancelling the colour selector on a custom layer configuration screen
 * Bug fix: fixed an absure bug that caused an error message when removing tiles from the world
 * Bug fix: implement a workaround for a bug that causes uninitialised custom terrain types to end up being used in a world. Such terrain types will now render and export as dirt

--- Version 0.11.2, released 24-10-2012

* Bug fix: fixed another problem with the random rotation of tile entities (chests, furnaces, etc.) that was preventing it from working correctly whenever an object was rotated one quarter or three quarter turns
* Bug fix: custom objects were not being placed if they collided with the ground, which was not by design. The collision detection now only works above ground. An object will dig into the ground if the ground slopes upward from the point where the origin of the object is placed. *Please note:* this means that objects will now be placed more frequently, especially on hilly ground!

--- Version 0.11.1, released 22-10-2012

* Added a thickness setting to custom ground cover layers, enabling you to create layers that are more than one block thick. You can make a glacier, for instance, by setting the block type to Ice, the thickness to 5 and painting it in with a solid brush and maximum intensity (don't forget to also paint a cold biome in the same area, otherwise the ice will melt)
* Bug fix: fixed a problem that caused tile entities (chests, furnaces, etc.) from schematics to lose their metadata (contents, etc.). To fix existing custom object layers, open their settings (by right-clicking on the layer button and choosing Edit...) and save them by pressing OK. This will cause the custom object files to be reloaded

--- Version 0.11, released 20-10-2012

* Added a Jungle forest layer. When painted at 50% intensity it should be similar to a Minecraft generated jungle, only more irregular. All features should be present, such as cocoa trees. All Minecraft vegetation types are now supported in WorldPainter, meaning that you should no longer need to use Populate
* Added support for .schematic files to the custom object layers. They will be randomly mirrored and rotated to add variety. You can mix bo2 objects and schematics in the same layer if you want to
* Tile entities and entities are supported for schematics, but this could not be tested due to a current bug in WorldEdit
* Custom objects will no longer collide or intersect each other (except for insubstantial blocks such as leaf blocks)
* Set the default brush for terrain type and layers to the plateau
* Improved the response and usability of the intensity slider
* When you create a new custom layer it is now automatically selected so that you can start to use it immediately
* The custom terrain buttons now have no terrain type selected by default, instead of defaulting to Dirt. If you click on them when they don't have a terrain type selected, the block type selection popup is automatically shown
* Bug fix: fixed a bunch of bugs with the random rotation and mirroring of custom objects, as well as adding support for some new block types
* Bug fix: attempt to work around a bug in Java that causes the biomes toolbar to be invisible when the Biomes layer is selected for the second time

--- Version 0.10.5, released 14-10-2012

* Added minimum height setting to Resources layer settings as well as Custom Underground Pockets layers
* Bug fix: correctly calculate light under water even when Resources layer is turned off
* Bug fix: render grass as dirt under water again
* Bug fix: when changing Resource layer settings of a world, the default settings on the Preferences screen would also change. This has been fixed and the Resource layer settings in the preferences will be reset to the defaults one time (even if you changed them manually, unfortunately)

--- Version 0.10.4, released 12-10-2012

* Bug fix: all biome buttons would be disabled if custom biomes was enabled, but no biome scheme was selected. This has been fixed
* All sand is now supported with a layer of sandstone, to prevent cave ins when using the Populate and Caverns layers together
* Adventure mode is now supported when exporting a world
* The randomRotation property of custom bo2 objects is now honoured. If it is present and set to false, the object will not be randomly rotated *or* mirrored
* Bug fix: wooden logs in custom bo2 objects are now rotated correctly

--- Version 0.10.3, released 16-9-2012

* Added a preview to the New World screen for immediate feedback of the topography and surface material settings
* The default Minecraft seed for new worlds is now fixed to seed 202961, which has a very large ocean around the origin. This means that you can create ocean all around the edges of your world and it will integrate neatly into the Minecraft world (if you leave the water level at the default of 62). Of course it also means that there will be no other land masses nearby
* Added an "always on top" button to the toolbar of the 3D view to keep the 3D view on top of the editor window
* Added option to Cavern layer settings to disable removal of water (and lava) above cavern openings, to stop holes from forming in oceans. Also changed default for new worlds to *not* removing the water
* Turn on "smooth snow" by default (also for existing installations), to make more people aware of it. You can turn it off per world on the Dimension Properties screen, or turn it off by default on the Preferences screen. Imported worlds will still have it turned off by default
* Added a maximum brush size option to the Preferences screen for powerful machines that can support large brush sizes. Be careful with setting this too large; performance exponentially goes down with larger brush sizes!
* The "circular world" option has been added to the Preferences screen
* Partial support for custom biomes from mods (maps with such biomes can now be imported and the custom biomes will be displayed using question marks, but you cannot paint custom biomes)
* Biomes that are not supported by the currently selected biome scheme are now disabled on the biomes palette when the Biomes tool is selected
* Better handling of attempted import of invalid or incomplete Minecraft maps
* Don't enable emerald by default for worlds last saved with a pre-emerald version of WorldPainter, to prevent problems when exporting to a pre-emerald version of Minecraft. You can still enable it manually on the Dimension Properties screen (Ctrl+P or Edit -> Dimension properties...)

--- Version 0.10.2, released 26-8-2012

* Added support for the Minecraft 1.3.2 minecraft.jar file
* When saving and exporting worlds, filenames are now sanitised so that they don't contain illegal characters causing errors
* WorldPainter now notifies you if it can't export or merge a world because it is in use by another program (such as Minecraft, Windows Explorer, a text editor with a mod config file open in it, etc.)
* Allow larger scaling (up to 10000%) and offset values (between -10000 and 10000) for overlay images
* Better handling of the user failing to provide a valid and correct minecraft.jar file when asked
* Better handling of the user failing to select a valid level.dat file when importing a map
* Bug fix: the custom object layer screen no longer allows selection of directories with no custom objects in them
* Bug fix: fixed an obscure error message that would occur in certain circumstances when trying to zoom using the mouse scroll wheel
* Bug fix: fixed an obscure error message that would occur in certain circumstances when trying to drag the map with the middle mouse button

--- Version 0.10.1, released 11-8-2012

* A bug was fixed that caused an error when exporting a world created with a previous version of WorldPainter

--- Version 0.10, released 11-8-2012

* Added support for Minecraft 1.3.1:
  - Support for using Minecraft 1.3.1. minecraft.jar for calculating and displaying biomes
  - Support for large biomes in the editor, the biomes viewer and the Export screen
  - Added emerald to the Resources layers. Note that it behaves differently than in Minecraft! Minecraft only generates emerald ore in Extreme Hills and Extreme Hills Edge biomes. WorldPainter makes no such distinction and generates them everywhere. If you don't want that, set the occurrence of emerald to 0‰ and use a custom underground pockets layer with block ID 129 to add emerald ore in the places and frequencies you want. Note also that emerald will also be added to existing .world files. If you don't want that, set the occurrence to 0‰
  - New setting on the Export screen to enable or disable cheats (single player commands)
* Added customisation of hill height and horizontal size to New World screen, along with new settings for defaults on the Preferences screen
* Added light direction to Preferences screen
* Added a link to the documentation (such as it is) on worldpainter.net to the Help menu, also accessible by pressing F1

--- Version 0.9.2, released 11-7-2012

* Create backups of existing files when saving .world files. The backups have a number appended to the filename, in front of the .world extension. The number of backups to keep can be configured on the Preferences screen. The default is three. If you do not want WorldPainter to create backups, set it to zero
* When merging, remove land entirely wherever the Void layer is used (an exception to the standard behaviour of not making any changes to the existing map below the surface)
* Assign shortcut Alt+w to Swamp layer
* Make error reporting work correctly on Java 7

--- Version 0.9.1, released 28-6-2012

* Bug fix: fix floating chunks of resources and custom underground pockets in caverns.

--- Version 0.9, released 28-6-2012

* New tree layer type: Swamp! It generates the same shape of trees as the Deciduous layer, but they are further apart and have vines on them. In addition it will have more mushrooms, lily pads will be placed on any water covered by the layer, and the default biome (if you are using Automatic Biomes) is Swampland.
* New custom layer type: underground pockets! It allows you to generate underground pockets of arbitrary block types. Use the plus button on the Layers panel to add it.
* You can now create circular worlds by checking the new "circular" check box on the Create New World screen. The first dimension spinner box becomes the diameter of the circle, which will be centred on the origin (coordinates 0,0). You can set the diameter in increments of 2 instead of 128, and it will create only the necessary tiles and use the Void layer to create the edge of the world. It will also set the border type to Void and border size to 256 blocks by default.
* The functionality to edit existing custom layers of all types has been added, by richt-clicking on the layer button and selecting Edit...
* It is now possible to delete existing custom layers by right-clicking on the layer button and selecting Remove...
* Keyboard shortcuts have been added for quickly selecting an intensity using the number keys: 1 through 9 select 10% through 90% intensity and 0 selects 100% intensity

--- Version 0.8.9, released 14-6-2012

* Bug fix: fix a deadlock which occurred when performing an Undo while the 3D view was open and still rendering tiles
* Bug fix: fix an error that occurred when falling back to the WorldPainter Backups directory in the user's home directory and it already existed

--- Version 0.8.8, released 14-6-2012

* Saving has been split into Save (which saves to the last used filename without prompting) and Save As (which asks for a filename and asks permission to overwrite), making it more similar to other programs
* When importing a height map, the biome scheme will now be set to automatic for 1.2 maps and none for 1.1 and earlier maps, and custom biomes will be enabled by default
* Memory usage while importing height maps has been slightly improved
* Some small cosmetic changes
* Bug fix: don't override the grid and contour display settings of existing .world files with the defaults configured in the preferences
* Bug fix: prevent an error related to using custom terrain types and automatic biomes
* Bug fix: work around a bug causing repeated error messages when painting the biomes under some circumstances
* Bug fix: work around a bug causing an error message when disabling the display of some layers

--- Version 0.8.7, released 12-5-2012

* World size is now configured and displayed in blocks instead of tiles (still in multiples of 128 though). Hopefully the psychological effect will make people want to create smaller maps
* The program tries to estimate whether you have enough memory to create the requested world size, and if not warns you (but still allows you to proceed, since it is hard to estimate accurately)
* The WorldPainter configuration directory (which also contains your custom brushes, if any) has been relocated to a more appropriate location on Windows and Mac OS X. WorldPainter will take care of migrating the existing directory and its contents, if any (excluding the log files)
* The undo and redo actions are now disabled whenever there is no more undo or redo information
* The Export screen now warns you if you export part of the map, and the spawn point is not on the selected tiles
* The warnings on the Export screen have been combined, so that it only ever shows one popup
* Bug fix: work around a mysterious error that occurs immediately after starting the program
* Bug fix: fix an error that occurred when rotating a world that has a Minecraft biome scheme selected and no custom biomes, but for which no minecraft.jar was provided

--- Version 0.8.6, released 29-4-2012

* Added a Reset button to the Preferences screen to reset the default world settings
* Worlds imported from existing Minecraft 1.2 ("Anvil") maps now have no default biome scheme selected. Custom biomes is still enabled by default, but right-clicking with the Biomes tool does nothing until you explicitly select a biome scheme from the Edit menu
* Bug fix: don't ignore the "surface material" setting in the default world settings section of the Preferences screen
* Bug fix: correctly position the 3D view when opening it even if the world is smaller than the main editor view
* Bug fix: correctly hide the Biomes layer when switching to the Nether or End dimensions
* Bug fix: correctly disable the Set Spawn Point tool and the Move To Spawn Point actions for the Nether and End dimensions

--- Version 0.8.5, released 28-4-2012

* Added Preferences screen (in Edit menu) for configuration of default view and world settings
* Increased the default number of undo levels to 100. It is now configurable on the new Preferences screen
* You can now rotate the direction of the light in the main editor view by pressing l or r on your keyboard, or the lightbulb icons on the toolbar
* Added buttons to toolbar of both the main view and the 3D view to quickly go to the spawn location or the origin (coordinates 0,0)
* When you open the 3D view it shows the same area as is currently visible in the main editor, instead of starting in the middle. If you press Ctrl+3 while the 3D view is already open, it will move to the currenlty visible area in the main view
* The 3D view now rotates around the centre of the view (more or less), instead of resetting to the middle whenever you rotate the view
* You can lock the toolbars so that you can't accidentally move them (View -> Lock toolbars...)
* Hidden layers are now indicated on the editor by displaying the layer icon with a red prohibition sign across them
* Added Tech Info tab to the About screen with technical information about the WorldPainter installation and runtime
* Bug fix: merging large worlds could cause I/O errors; this should be fixed now
* Bug fix: improve stability when zooming in and out with the mouse
* Bug fix: when Flooding with water or lava, stop at places that have been painted with the Void layer
* Bug fix: don't draw contour lines over places that have been painted with the Void layer
* Bug fix: fix obscure error when closing 3D view and/or entire program

--- Version 0.8.4, released 25-4-2012

* Bug fix: when selecting a subset of tiles for export on the Export screen not all selected tiles were being exported. This has been fixed!

--- Version 0.8.3, released 24-4-2012

* Bug fix: restore the export of borders and bedrock walls, and fix the lighting calculation of border chunks. Note that there is a bug in Minecraft which is triggered by using a lava border without a bedrock wall. If the lava abuts large amounts of water on the outside, Minecraft may crash. Also note that borders and bedrock walls are not exported if you make a tile selection on the Export screen (even if you select all tiles)

--- Version 0.8.2, released 23-4-2012

* Added optional display of the view distance around the cursor. Click the new "eye" button on the toolbar to enable it. It shows a dotted circle around the cursor indicating how far you would be able to see (when using the "far" view distance setting) if you were standing at that location
* Added optional display of walking distances around the cursor. Click the new button showing a person and an arrow on the toolbar to enable it. It shows three concentric dotted circles around the cursor showing respectively how far you could walk in five minutes, thirteen minutes (a full day including dusk and dawn) and twenty minutes (a full day/night cycle). Note that these circles are very large, so you will only see them if the map is big enough and you have zoomed out sufficiently!
* Added new custom layer type: "ground cover layer", which adds a one block thick layer of any block type you wish on top of the terrain. Use it to add vegetation, etc.
* Added the "dimension properties", "change height" and "rotate" functions to the tool bar
* Added "smooth snow" option to Frost layer, which causes snow blocks to have varying heights and look smoother. Note that it only works with worlds created in WorldPainter, not worlds imported from Minecraft maps!
* Added "reset all water" and "reset all terrain" functions to global operations which respectively reset all water and lava to the default level and type, and reset all terrain types to the altitude dependent defaults
* Bug fix: fix a structural error when using the "merge biomes only" option
* Bug fix: fix trails left behind the brush when zoomed out

--- Version 0.8.1, released 22-4-2012

* The Great Shift of 2012! The coordinate system has been rotated and shifted so that it now corresponds to Minecraft's and north is now finally up! The consequence is that worlds imported *before* the Great Shift can no longer be merged using this version of WorldPainter. If you have imported worlds which you absolutely need to be able to merge, keep a copy of version 0.7.3 around! But for most people that should not be necessary; you can just import the map again with the new version. Also, biome calculation for Minecraft versions is disabled for worlds created before the Great Shift (automatic and custom biomes still work)
* As part of the Great Shift a world rotation function had been added. WorldPainter will automatically offer to rotate existing worlds when you load them, so that north is up. You can also rotate worlds later using the new Rotate... menu item in the Edit menu, which allows you to rotate it 90 or 180 degrees. The rotate function rotates all dimensions
* New parallel export process which makes use of multiple cores and is *much* quicker than the old process
* Added configurable height contour lines. By default they are turned on and displayed every ten blocks. They can be configured using the toolbar button or the Configure view... (Ctrl+V) menu item in the View menu
* New function to export the world image as an image file. It is accessible through the menu as File -> Export -> Export as image file.... The Export as Minecraft map... function has been moved to this new Export sub menu as well. The image will be exported as displayed on screen, with the exception of the grid and the overlay image, so make sure to configure the visible layers as you want them before exporting the image
* New function to export the world image as a height map. It is accessible through the menu as File -> Export -> Export as height map.... A height map is a grey scale image file which is brighter for higher areas. The image format to use will be determined from the file name extension. If you don't type an extension, PNG will be used. If your world is higher than 256, make sure to use a format which supports 16-bit grey scale (such as PNG)! And be aware that not all software can work (well) with 16-bit grey scale images
* Added toolbar for quick access to often used menu items and draw attention to some little known functionality
* Added toolbar to 3D view with rotate buttons to draw attention to the view rotation functionality
* New function to export the 3D world view as an image file by pressing the new export button on the toolbar of the 3D view
* Decreased maximum memory allocation for 32-bit Windows systems to 1 GB in an effort to reduce JVM startup errors
* Bug fix: fixed a sporadic error while exporting custom bo2 objects at very high altitudes
* Bug fix: fixed a sporadic error from the graphical user interface when a layer is not selected

--- Version 0.8, not released

--- Version 0.7.3, released 13-4-2012

* Installer now automatically sets the maximum memory allocation to the recommended maximum
* Bug fix: update automatic biomes when applicable on the global operations screen
* Bug fix: correctly take needsFoundation property into account when rendering custom bo2 objects

--- Version 0.7.2, released 11-4-2012

* Bug fix: don't render air as black blocks in the bo2 object preview
* Bug fix: biomes were not being merged or exported under some circumstances on worlds which were imported from an existing map. This has been fixed; when applicable the biomes will now always be merged, including manual edits, if any

--- Version 0.7.1, released 8-4-2012

* Bug fix: disabling the biome scheme was not saved with the world file, so that when it was next loaded the biome scheme was active again. This has been fixed. You will need to disable the biome scheme and save the file one last time to make it stick

--- Version 0.7, released 7-4-2012

* Partial exports! It is now possible to export only part of the world by selecting tiles from the Exporting screen, for instance to create relatively quick test renders of large worlds
* Automatic biomes! A new biome scheme, which is now the default, which sets the biome automatically according to the terrain type and layers used
* Java 5 is no longer supported, from this release Java 6 or higher is required
* Mountain and Height tools speeds have been increased. The half way setting of the intensity slider now corresponds to the old maximum speed, the full setting is four times faster
* It is now possible to turn the noisy edges of the terrain types when using the Mountain tool or right-clicking with the Terrain tool on and off on the Default Terrain tab of the Edit Dimension Properties screen
* Added button to copy error details to clipboard to error dialog

--- Version 0.6.12, released 3-4-2012

* Add support for Minecraft 1.2.5 jar file
* Add specific error message when trying to import a map which is too large
* Add button to tools panel for global (fill and clear) operations
* Changed caching mechanism for exporting the world, which should take about the same time using less memory, and might even be faster when exporting very large worlds on a memory constrained system

--- Version 0.6.11, released 29-3-2012

* Bug fix: auto update checking mechanism was accidentally disabled, it has now been reenabled

--- Version 0.6.10, released 29-3-2012

* Add support for creating an End dimension!
* When adding a Nether, don't enable resources by default, and use the same terrain for all altitudes by default

--- Version 0.6.9, released 29-3-2012

* New functionality: configure altitude to terrain type mapping. This is the mapping used when right-clicking with a Terrain tool selected, or when using the Mountain tool. A new tab called Default Terrain has been added to the dimension properties editor (Edit -> Dimension properties or Ctrl+P) which allows you to change the levels and default terrain types and add or remove terrain types. The same tab (called Terrain) is also available when importing a height map
* New functionality: global operations. Accessible as Edit -> Global operations... or by pressing Ctrl+G, this new screen allows you to fill the entire world with a particular terrain type, layer or biome, and remove or invert layers
* Show terrain type icon wherever you can select a terrain type

--- Version 0.6.8, released 27-3-2012

* New, powerful and easy to use add/remove tiles screen for increasing or decreasing the size of the world (Edit -> Add/remove tiles... or press Ctrl+T)
* New way of creating new worlds in particular locations or shapes using the Biomes viewer (Tools -> Biomes viewer, select tiles using left mouse button, select Create world in toolbar)
* Add support for Minecraft 1.2.4 minecraft.jar
* Custom biomes have been made the default for new worlds
* Bug fix: don't hide biomes when checkbox is deselected while the Biomes tool is selected

--- Version 0.6.7, released 18-3-2012

* Make edges of patches of tall grass on Grass terrain more irregular
* Export chunk sections that contain no blocks but do contain lighting, improving initial lighting when first loading map
* When rendering custom bo2 objects always replace underground blocks, allowing objects do dig out voids, replace dirt and stone, etc.
* Bug fix: don't mirror custom bo2 object preview in file selector
* Bug fix: properly mirror blocks when mirroring custom objects
* Bug fix: properly rotate custom objects
* Bug fix: properly constrain terrain height when reducing maximum world height
* Bug fix: prevent obscure error when closing biome viewer and/or main window

--- Version 0.6.6, released 17-3-2012

* Add change log to About screen
* Bug fix: fix an error introduced in the previous release that occurred when loading a world that contains custom bo2 object layers

--- Version 0.6.5, released 15-3-2012

* Add option to merge only the biomes to an imported map, which is much quicker and less destructive than merging everything
* Fix size of various windows on Windows
* Offer to save unsaved changes before importing a Minecraft map or height map
* Bug fix: correctly rotate blocks from when rendering rotated and/or mirrored bo2 custom objects

--- Version 0.6.4, released 14-3-2012

* Bug fix: don't remove glowstone when importing and then merging a map
* Remember the directory from which a bo2 custom object file or files was last loaded
* Attempt to support Mac OS X Tiger

--- Version 0.6.3, released 9-3-2012

* Bug fix: import flowing/active water correctly
* Bug fix: determine height difference more correctly when merging worlds (try to prevent buried trees, etc.)

--- Version 0.6.2, released 8-3-2012

* Add a store of wood and a crafting table to the chest of goodies
* When creating caverns the floor of the caverns is correctly set to the top block type of the selected underground material, for instance grass or mycelium
* When creating a new world use the best available biome scheme as the default, instead of always using Minecraft 1.2
* Bug fix: don't throw NPE when loading a world and the user does not select a valid minecraft.jar
* Bug fix: make adding tiles work once again in terms of calculating the biomes and clearing the undo history
* Bug fix: fix sporadic error message when exporting a world with caverns

--- Version 0.6.1, released 7-3-2012

* Bug fix: various errors fixed when importing existing Minecraft maps
* Bug fix: attempt to fix repaint problem with biomes palette on Windows

--- Version 0.6, released 6-3-2012

* Biome painting! The biome scheme setting has been moved from the View menu to the Edit menu. Set the biome scheme to "custom biomes" to customise the biomes and then use the Biomes layer button like any other layer to paint the biomes. When you select the Biomes layer, a new biomes palette pops up on which you can select the biome to paint. Right-clicking restores the biomes to what they were before you switched to custom biomes
* When creating a new world you can now choose the biome scheme, and you can also indicate that you want to customise the biomes
* You can use this functionality to change the biomes of existing Minecraft maps. Don't forget to remove the read-only layer everywhere you want to change the biomes! As long as you leave the terrain height alone this should not be dangerous
* The "Biomes viewer" tool now also supports Minecraft 1.2. You can switch between Minecraft 1.1 and 1.2
* Bug fix: mycelium is now only rendered on top of the terrain; the blocks underneath are rendered as dirt (just like with the grass terrain type)
* Bug fix: the Mountain tool works better with lower intensity settings. It still does not work well with custom brushes though. Specifically, it does not work well with brushes where the centre pixel is not at full intensity
* Bug fix: on imported worlds "resources everywhere" is now turned off (just as previously the subsurface material was set to Stone instead of Resources). This should make newly imported worlds merge quicker. As part of this change the subsurface material selection has also been removed from the Merge screen

--- Version 0.5.14, released 4-3-2012

* Bug fix: intensity settings were being mixed up between the terrain height tools and the terrain type and layer painting tools. One symptom of this is that the Mountain tool intermittently appeared to stop working completely

--- Version 0.5.13, released 3-3-2012

* Add support for Minecraft 1.2 for the biomes preview. This is not yet custom biome painting!

--- Version 0.5.12, released 3-3-2012

Note that Minecraft build 12w07b still crashes when loading bedrock wall chunks! I don't know if this is a bug in Minecraft or in WorldPainter, but for now don't use bedrock walls for Minecraft 1.2 exports!
